36
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,799
2022

37
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,000
this is episode number 252

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,360
of what on earth is happening, and we

39
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,800
have a great show lined up for you here

40
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,800
today we're going to be continuing

41
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,080
discussing the occult tradition of

42
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,680
thelema

43
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,680
this is the occult philosophy of thelema part 2 - is the title of this show

44
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,599
please, do keep in mind that what on

45
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,120
earth is happening

46
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,239
is cumulative information

47
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,879
that means that if you are a new viewer

48
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,640
or listener to the show

49
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,120
you should not start from here, you

50
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,360
should go back to episode number 1 on

51
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,280
my podcast page

52
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,519
and you should listen in order starting

53
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,000
with number 1 proceeding through the

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,360
podcasts

55
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,440
in numerical order without skipping

56
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,440
around at your own pace, this is because

57
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,599
earlier episodes

58
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,720
have prerequisite information in them

59
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,360
that are required to understand the

60
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,040
information that is covered in later

61
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,440
episodes, each episode of what on earth

62
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,840
is happening does not stand on its own

63
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,080
the information is cumulative, and it is

64
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,360
presented in a stepwise progression

65
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,200
so, i'm going to continue to re-emphasize

66
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,800
that, please, do keep that in mind if

67
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,239
you're a new viewer

68
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,040
today is may 1st, it is the

69
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,319
closing of what is known as the occult

70
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,440
season of sacrifice, and i should qualify

71
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,840
that and call it "the dark occult season

72
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,440
of sacrifice"

73
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,640
this is a 40-day time period

74
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,000
where dark occultists often offer a

75
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,120
blood sacrifice to the sun and earth

76
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,280
as part of their sick

77
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,840
demented

78
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,120
psychopathic religion

79
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,680
and religious beliefs

80
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,400
in

81
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,560
some forms of satanism and dark

82
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,560
occultism

83
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,720
whereby they believe that human blood

84
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,840
has to be

85
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,000
sacrificed and given to earth, given to

86
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,480
the earth during a certain time period

87
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,159
of the year namely

88
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,360
the first 40 days of the spring

89
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,200
season, up through the midpoint of spring

90
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,319
which is one of the major occult sabbats

91
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,478
or high holidays of the year

92
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,160
as is today

93
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,880
may 1st - it is the

94
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,280
the major sabbat of the year, it's one of

95
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,600
the four major sabbats, but among them it

96
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,320
is

97
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,560
the most important to the dark occultist

98
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,199
this is may day, or what is known in the

99
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,639
dark occult world as Walpurgisnacht

100
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,919
Saint Walpurgis's Night

101
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,440
the

102
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,160
culmination of which is at midnight

103
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,759
between

104
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,680
april 13th and may 1st, when the

105
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,240
day is just changing to may 1st

106
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,960
it is probably the day of the year

107
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,400
on which

108
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,440
the most ritual sacrifices literally

109
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,960
bloodletting and blood sacrifices

110
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,280
takes place during the course of

111
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,840
the entire occult calendar

112
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,560
so, today is a day that people should be

113
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,800
especially vigilant of geopolitical

114
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,680
events and possible false flag events

115
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,360
because they love to bring them out on

116
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,840
mayday 5-1

117
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,240
that is the magic number in the world of

118
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,479
the occult, because they see this

119
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,919
as the tipping point of having

120
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,479
a small amount over half, when you have

121
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,199
the majority of people

122
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,759
then you are able to wield

123
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,440
power over

124
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,440
aggregate consciousness

125
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,360
this is why

126
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,639
the high holiday is on 5-1, this is

127
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,880
why the base where they

128
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,400
keep technological secrets about

129
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,080
different forms of energy and

130
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,440
propulsion

131
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,440
is area 5-1, 51

132
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,560
and that's why it's considered the

133
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,759
magic number in the occult

134
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,080
numerological system

135
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,120
51 is the number by which consciousness

136
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,319
actually

137
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,960
reaches a tipping point many people

138
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,720
will insist that that is wrong and

139
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,919
disagree -

140
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,840
it is not

141
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,720
this is something that i constantly

142
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,600
get

143
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,840
battles with people over

144
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,160
that insist that you only need a small

145
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,319
amount of people to turn aggregate

146
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,680
consciousness -

147
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,919
that is absolutely incorrect, that is new

148
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,520
age bullshit, that is new age nonsense

149
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,840
you need the majority of people to turn

150
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,080
consciousness in a different direction

151
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,479
you do not need a small amount of people

152
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,880
whoever keeps saying that either is an

153
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,600
ignoramus, or they're willfully lying to

154
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,759
you to deceive you, to make you think

155
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,360
that the problem is

156
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,360
lesser than what it is, and is going to

157
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,440
require less effort than what it is

158
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,280
actually going to require

159
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,120
to truly create

160
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,440
a tipping point or an aggregate

161
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,000
consciousness changeover

162
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,960
you are going to require more than half

163
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,440
of the population to think differently

164
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,199
and behave differently

165
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,639
and if you don't have that straight in

166
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,560
your mind, and you still think it's gonna

167
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,880
be like 3 or 4 percent of people -

168
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,880
you are sorely mistaken and you're going

169
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,000
to be

170
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,639
very sorely disappointed

171
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,319
because that's not how it works in the

172
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,680
real world

173
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,520
and the people who are involved in the

174
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,720
occult world

175
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,440
have this knowledge, they've had it...

176
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,000
since time immemorial, since long before

177
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
you and i were born

178
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,680
they understand how the mass

179
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,919
consciousness dynamic works

180
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,759
they understand how the human psyche

181
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,960
works

182
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,199
and they know the numbers, they know the

183
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,400
proportions that are going to be

184
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,160
involved to really make any real change

185
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,199
happen

186
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,199
and that's why when anything really does

187
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,800
happen, that could possibly flip that

188
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,479
dynamic

189
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,319
they very much come together and take

190
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,240
real world action to prevent that change

191
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,800
from taking place in most cases

192
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,560
in some cases

193
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,599
they are not all powerful

194
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,440
in most cases they are

195
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,039
exercising their will, exercising their

196
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,639
power in the world

197
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,960
in a real world dynamic, not in just

198
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,720
wishing for it to happen, as we're going

199
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,720
to talk a lot about today continuing to

200
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,879
talk about thelema

201
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,639
they come together

202
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,960
in the real, very real physical world, and

203
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,720
they make it happen

204
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,080
they don't wish for it to happen, they

205
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,560
don't think about it, they do it

206
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,199
they're unified in their thoughts

207
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,640
and their emotions

208
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,640
about what they want to see happen, about

209
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,039
what they feel

210
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,519
is right for them and what they feel

211
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,279
should be occurring and should happen

212
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,360
but then the all-important dynamic is

213
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,519
they use their willpower, and they make

214
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,440
it happen in the real world

215
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,120
that's the dynamic that makes it

216
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,360
different from the average human being

217
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,279
that doesn't exert their will, and

218
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,160
doesn't actually use their behavior

219
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,080
their actions, to create the real world

220
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,240
change, they believe this new age

221
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,279
bullshit

222
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,600
this new age religion, that i just need

223
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,920
to think about it, and have the emotion

224
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,800
in my

225
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,600
emotional body to want it to happen, and

226
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,279
then magically the universe is going to

227
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,959
grant it to me - and it doesn't work that

228
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,720
way, you could think that that's how it

229
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,240
works all you want

230
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,279
and you'll be eternally wrong

231
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,880
you're free to believe that, you're free

232
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,200
to be stupid, you're free to be incorrect

233
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,880
you're free to be completely wrong and

234
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,120
fucked up, but

235
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,200
there is an actual way that things

236
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,279
really do work

237
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,440
and your owners know this, your masters

238
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,600
know this, and they're using it against

239
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,040
you, and they're telling you a bunch of

240
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,519
nonsense, lies and bullshit

241
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,200
and cramming it down your throat and

242
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,120
most of you are believing it wholesale

243
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,279
and i'm the bad guy for telling you that

244
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,720
it doesn't work the way the new age

245
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,200
bullshitters have told you that it works

246
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,880
i'm the bad guy, because i've told you

247
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,839
the real way that it actually does work -

248
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,240
that occultists who are running the

249
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,320
world have known for

250
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,440
tens of thousands of years

251
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,360
forget in the last couple hundred years

252
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,200
or in the last hundred years, they've

253
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,360
known this for millennia

254
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,160
while

255
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,640
our sorry asses {in/and} the aggregate of

256
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,440
humanity have sat on with our thumbs up

257
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,800
our ass and remained ignorant dupes

258
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,800
so, once again, get as offended as you

259
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,120
like about that's those statements

260
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,440
it's the truth nonetheless whether you

261
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,959
accept it or not

262
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,040
and you're free to remain an ignorant

263
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,680
fool, but that's actually how it really

264
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,800
does work

265
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,079
and that's why

266
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,320
today is their high holiday, that's why

267
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,120
they picked the number 51

268
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,839
and that is why it is the

269
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,480
ending the culmination of the season of

270
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,920
sacrifice

271
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,399
and we haven't seen drastically big

272
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,519
events

273
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,360
with the exception of, of course, the war

274
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,040
in Ukraine

275
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,519
which is a whole polarizing dynamic in

276
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,160
and of itself to balkanize people, and to

277
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,519
just create

278
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,399
total

279
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,640
polarization dialectics

280
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,800
in the masses, to get them

281
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,480
in fear, to get them fighting with each

282
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,079
other, so, that they're easier to rule

283
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,399
but, you know, we are at that point of

284
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,399
the midpoint of spring which is their

285
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,240
high sabbath of the year - Walpurgis

286
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,800
nacht, so, the day isn't over

287
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,279
so, i would still recommend caution

288
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,959
not that they could

289
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,880
not pull these false flag events at any

290
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,480
given time, but

291
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,920
again, i expect a big one at some point

292
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,600
on may the 1st

293
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,279
some coming year

294
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,880
whether, you know, what happens this year

295
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,839
or not, regardless of that fact

296
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,800
they love this day and

297
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,440
they stay very

298
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,640
much

299
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,760
rigid

300
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,000
in their patterns, they don't need to

301
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,639
change their patterns and change their

302
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,200
dynamics, because

303
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,200
it works, it has been working for

304
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,360
millennia, it works

305
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,639
to this day

306
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,560
and, so, there's no reason for them to

307
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,200
really adjust or change their tactics

308
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,519
as long as they continue to work for

309
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,360
them

310
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,959
so, that being said, i have a few

311
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,320
housekeeping announcements and then

312
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,399
we'll get into part 2 of

313
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,360
thelemic philosophy today

314
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,200
let me jump over to my slides -

315
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,680
thanks to Will Keller for the great

316
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,680
artwork

317
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,480
again, this is episode number 252 of what

318
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,320
on earth is happening

319
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,959
the title is the occult philosophy of

320
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,720
thelema, part 2

321
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,760
we're on a streamlined show format

322
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,079
and on a "6 month on / 6 month off"

323
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,079
schedule

326
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,920
we'll return to hiatus

total of 23 class sessions

387
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,720
we do have a limited amount of space

388
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,639
available in the seminar

389
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,800
we have reached

390
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,279
between two thirds and three quarters of

391
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,880
the number

392
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,639
that i'm going to allow for enrollment

393
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,639
in the seminar this year so

394
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,399
please listen to this folks for people

395
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,800
who are preparing to enroll we have now

396
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,560
reached

397
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,600
just under the three-quarter mark

398
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,360
where if we hit

399
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,560
another 25 percent of enrollments

400
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,480
i'm going to close enrollment so that

401
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,399
the

402
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,199
seminar doesn't reach an unwieldy number

403
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,560
of students

404
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,920
because i want to keep it somewhat

405
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,440
personalized

406
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,800
so

407
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,399
do not wait until the last minute to

408
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,480
enroll because i

409
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,800
may in fact be closing enrollment early

410
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,480
i may go right until the last moment

411
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,320
depending on how things go

412
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,560
but i just want people to keep in mind i

413
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,800
could close enrollment at any given time

414
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,399
if i hit the number that i want to reach

415
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,079
i just want to put that out there for

416
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,000
people so they're not surprised if

417
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,720
suddenly the enrollment button goes gray

418
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,120
or is taken off that page

419
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,279
and i close enrollments

420
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,079
so just so you were warned do not wait

421
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,800
until the last minute to enroll

422
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,040

decentralized

544
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,559
network

545
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,799
of

546
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,240

on the internet

549
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,159
if you have a internet connection of 200

550
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,559
megabits per second or greater in the

551
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,799
upstream direction you are initially

552
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,000
qualified

553
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,880
to

554
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,000
host a what on earth is happening ipfs

555
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,720
node we want to try to hit 10 nodes by

556
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,480
the end of the year so far we only have

557
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,039
one operating and there's still some

558
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,720
issues that we're attempting to work out

559
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,039
with that however you know we have a

560
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,720
long way to go to meet our goals with

561
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,400
this project

562
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,400
it's not super technical

563
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,880
it simply requires a little bit of will

564
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,760
power to get the note up and going and

565
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,919
now i think we can still hit that goal

566
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,840
if we get some

567
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,679
interested people that want to take part

568
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,000

00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,640
here at water north is happening many

604
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,559

605
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,200
this great offer and i hope many more

606
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,360
will still to come

607
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,440
i'm receiving at least an arc a day to

608
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,280
be honest with you guys it's it's pretty

609
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,440
amazing how many people want this

610
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,000
knowledge and it's a good sign to see

611
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,760
that that is happening

612
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,440
so uh arcs are coming in continually

613
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,320
the ark is a two terabyte hard drive

614
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,960
consisting of over twenty six thousand

615
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,120
audio files in the form of lectures and

616
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,400
podcasts

617
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,960
nine thousand five hundred digital books

618
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,640
three thousand four hundred digital

619
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,279
videos all from my own personal archive

620
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,960
of research and data that i've collected

621
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,279
over the years and compiled into a huge

622
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,760
digital library

623
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,919
that's copied onto the two terabyte hard

624
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,919
drive that you provide

625
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,760
to get the shipping instructions fill

626
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,840
out the form at what on earth is

627
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,320
happening dot com slash ark

628
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,400
there are rigid shipping instructions to

629
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,720
protect your property

630
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,600
we will very occasionally get a damaged

631
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,080
ark that arrives from someone that sends

632
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,400
to take us up on this offer we hate it

633
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,960
when that happens sometimes

634
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,440
you know people might pack it a little

635
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,840
bit inadequately sometimes it is the

636
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,840
fault of the carrier

637
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,919
so follow the shipping instructions

638
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,360
exactly to protect your property make

639
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,600
sure if anything does go wrong during

640
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,760
shipment of the ark you can file an

641
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,520
insurance claim with the carrier that

642
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,799
you chose

643
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:44,480
uh to carry the the the drive okay and

644
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,400
uh just follow the shipping instructions

645
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,039
they're very simple actually they're

646
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:49,840
they're

647
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,039
detailed to make it very specific in

648
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,919
language but they're not hard to follow

649
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,559
it's a very simple procedure that makes

650
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,720
sure that everything is protected and

651
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,039
you could file a claim if there is some

652
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,840
kind of damage during shipment it's rare

653
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,080
it's rare it's like maybe

654
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,919
less than one percent of the time if

655
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,440
that okay very very rarely do we receive

656
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,400
or

657
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,640
in going back in the in the reverse

658
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,640
shipping direction do we find that

659
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,880
drives are damaged but it does happen

660
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,120
and that's why i ask people please

661
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,640
follow the shipping instructions

662
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,080
carefully

663
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,159
to ensure that your property will not

664
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,320
have any damage happen to it i just want

665
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,159
to say also that

666
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,400
solid state drives have really dropped

667
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,600
in price

668
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,080
dramatically over the last several years

669
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,840
when i was first buying solid state

670
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,159
drives in this business and doing this

671
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:42,960
work

672
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,760
um

673
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,200
let me tell you something they were

674
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,080
ultra expensive i mean ultra expensive

675
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,480
like a terabyte solid state drive was

676
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,640
over a thousand dollars you know when

677
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,679
they first came out like 12 12.50 you

678
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:56,480
know

679
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,039
some good ones 1500.

680
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,520
you know i i got my first solid state

681
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,480
drive ever years ago probably back in

682
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,880
like 2011 or something

683
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,039
and it was a thousand dollars and i

684
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,480
thought that was a good price at the

685
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,880
time i like waited for that drive to

686
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,799
drop to a thousand dollars

687
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,720
now you can get a two terabyte hard

688
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,520
drive for like under 200 bucks so i'm

689
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,919
really going to recommend a solid state

690
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,919
drive for the ark if you can afford it

691
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:25,919
i'm not telling anybody they must do

692
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,919
that i'll put it on a regular hard drive

693
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,600
for you if that's what you wish

694
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,760
but i'm just saying that there's far

695
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,159
less of any incident in damaging it

696
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,520
through shipping

697
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,360
through jostling the drive or dropping

698
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,760
it or anything like that far far far

699
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,240
less of any chance of any damage

700
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,720
occurring to a solid-state drive

701
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,559
rather than to a hard drive which there

702
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,799
still is a legitimate chance there could

703
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,559
be damage in shipping to a hard drive

704
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,279
it's again even that is very rare with

705
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,720
an arc drive but

706
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,320
just want to put the word out there put

707
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,400
the recommendation out there i

708
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,240
personally highly recommend putting your

709
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,400
arc drive on a two terabyte solid state

710
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,559
drive you'll probably never have an

711
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:05,919
issue with the drive in your entire

712
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,799
lifetime and the drive will be much more

713
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:12,240
robust uh in shipping and uh you know or

714
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,799
just any potential damage like it

715
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,400
falling off your desk or something like

716
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,760
that it's it's uh almost indestructible

717
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,640
uh a decent solid state drive so

718
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,279
um if you do have the resources for that

719
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,120
that is what i personally recommend for

720
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,480
the arc drive just putting that out

721
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,960
there into the ethers for people

722
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,480
so if you want to take advantage of the

723
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,039
great arc offer arc 2.0 available

724
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,559

housekeeping that i have, we're going to

787
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,720
continue

788
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,159
discussing the thelemic philosophy, the

789
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,279
occult philosophy of thelema on the

790
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:02,799
broadcast today

791
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,320
i'm going to pick up where we left off

792
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,640
last week and jump ahead to

793
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,440
we had just completed talking about not

794
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,720
only

795
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,760
thelemic gematria or

796
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,799
occult numerology and the significance

797
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,279
and the importance, and the allegoric

798
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:21,360
significance of the

799
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,679
number, occult

800
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:25,760
numerological system

801
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,880
of that is often used in the thelemic

802
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,399
philosophy to

803
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:33,120
represent ideas and to create

804
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,440
correlative thinking between

805
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,200
number

806
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,799
and philosophy, number and

807
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:42,880
conceptualized concepts that are covered

808
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,039
in the philosophy of thelema

809
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:47,120
this is done in many occult

810
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,159
traditions, it's done in freemasonry, it's

811
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,279
done in kabbalah, and it's absolutely a

812
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:55,120
crucial part of

813
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,440
the thelemic philosophy

814
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,240
we closed up last week talking about

815
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,120
what magick is in thelema

816
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,480
and how it is

817
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,000
a form of mental influence, it is a form

818
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,240
of action at a distance, we looked at the

819
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,159
symbology of thelema in things like

820
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,240
the unicursal hexagram

821
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,240
we'll continue to look at some symbology

822
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,120
today, because symbology is rich

823
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,399
in the tradition of thelema, as well

824
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:27,279
and we talked about

825
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,840
magick versus sorcery

826
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,840
that if the influence that you're

827
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,440
attempting to exert

828
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,799
and to inspire others using

829
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:40,480
to convey your knowledge to them

830
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,960
through mental influence

831
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,600
through setting an example in your life

832
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,600
and inspiring others

833
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,440
that is a form of magick, that is what i

834
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,279
call higher magick, that is what many

835
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:52,880
occult practitioners have called higher

836
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,519
magick, we're not talking about invocation

837
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,840
of spirits and casting spells - that is

838
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,440
what is known in the occult world as

839
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,880
lesser magick

840
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,640
that is what i certainly consider the

841
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,799
lesser form of magick

842
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:07,919
because often that is done to

843
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,440
manipulate something according to the

844
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,200
way you want to see it go, it's often

845
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,320
done to acquire resources, it's done to

846
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,480
placate and or

847
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,840
satiate

848
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,519
the lesser will

849
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,519
the individual selfish will of the

850
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,200
practitioner

851
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,360
that's not what i consider real magick

852
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,159
that's not what true thelemites consider

853
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,640
real magic, that's not what higher level

854
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,399
occultists

855
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:37,200
truly consider genuine magick

856
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,039
that is what has been known in the

857
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:40,640
different occult traditions throughout

858
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,840
the years as lesser magick, and it is a

859
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,640
form of quote-unquote magick, it is a form

860
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,760
of the art and science of influencing

861
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,360
change to occur

862
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,640
but, however

863
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,640
most of that type of change in lesser

864
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,440
magick is occurring in accordance with

865
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,679
the earthly appetites and the earthly

866
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:00,799
will

867
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,000
my will

868
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,399
not thy will, not the will of creation

869
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,840
not the will of the universe, not the

870
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,679
will of the cosmos

871
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,080
when we put our intention and effort

872
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,600
into

873
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,960
allowing

874
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,039
the expression and the culmination, and

875
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,320
the fulfillment of the will of the

876
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,200
cosmos, then we are aligning our

877
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,080
individuated will with the capital "w"-

878
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,640
will, the higher will of creation

879
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,960
and therefore that is doing

880
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,600
the true will, and that is what is

881
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,600
referred to in the occult as greater

882
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,559
magick

883
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,320
higher magick

884
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,760
and that's the magick that we're talking

885
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,640
about in the thelemic tradition

886
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,679
when very advanced occult practitioners

887
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,080
who i would refer to as higher level

888
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,519
dark occultists

889
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,440
who crowley and many other

890
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,720
occultists in the, you know, 19th and

891
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,799
20th centuries referred to as sorcerers

892
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,880
when they are exercising their own

893
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,559
selfish will

894
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,559
that's not real magick

895
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,320
that is what is delineated in the

896
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,840
thelemic tradition as

897
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:08,639
sorcery, as the lesser form of magick, the

898
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,359
the selfish will of the practitioner

899
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:12,719
being

900
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,560
used to influence

901
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,800
and bring other people into harmony in

902
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,000
accordance with, so, that... the selfish

903
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,119
practitioner gets their way and their

904
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,800
will is fulfilled

905
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,639
that's not what we're talking about when

906
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,320
we say

907
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,159
"do what thou wilt shall be the whole of

908
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,199
the law"

909
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,918
we're talking about the capital "w"-will

910
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:37,040
the higher will of creation, that is it

911
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,480
is our charge in our spiritual lives to

912
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,679
align our behaviors too

913
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:44,719
and, so,

914
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,960
we talked about that as being the

915
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,599
delineating factor, the factor that

916
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:53,440
separates true magick as crowley spelled

917
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,960
it, and, you know, worded it magick with a k

918
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,400
higher magic

919
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,200
from

920
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,040
the lesser will

921
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,359
influence, the art and science of

922
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,119
influencing change to occur in

923
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:06,720
accordance with the selfish will of the

924
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,760
practitioner which he and many other

925
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,680
occultists of his day referred to as

926
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,359
sorcery

927
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:15,040
and that is what i would call it, and i

928
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,079
would call it dark occultism, as well

929
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:20,160
so, the last concept that we left off on

930
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,440
which i'm going to go ahead and jump

931
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,040
right over to was

932
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,520
the concept in thelema of the holy

933
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,440
guardian angel

934
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,880
and

935
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,560
this is a concept of connection to

936
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,440
that higher self, that helps you to align

937
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,839
your behavior to the higher will of

938
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,280
creation, to the higher will of the

939
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,839
cosmos

940
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:42,640
and

941
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,599
he...

942
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:46,079
crowley worded this in the writings that

943
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,560
he put forward about the holy guardian

944
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,760
angel as

945
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,480
it was a a force of guidance

946
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,160
it was a force of

947
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,359
intelligence, that if we were aligning

948
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:58,640
our behavior

949
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,040
and our intent with the true will, that

950
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,520
this force of creation would guide us on

951
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,400
that path and help us to stay on that

952
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,720
path and not fall from it, clearly

953
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:13,480
crowley himself did not do that

954
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,560
and that... that is why

955
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,520
it is of utmost importance to learn

956
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,440
how to separate

957
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,640
the way

958
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,520
an individual in

959
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,000
physicality, in the 3d world, here on

960
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,880
earth

961
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,720
lives their life

962
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,839
versus

963
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,839
what some of the teachings that they

964
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:37,520
have presented during the course of

965
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,440
their life are

966
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,599
and the value that those teachings have

967
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,839
for others

968
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:46,880
therefore i would be the very last

969
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,640
person to tell you

970
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,359
go and revere crowley himself - not a good

971
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,440
idea

972
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,760
i am the last person who would tell you

973
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,560
become what is known as a crowleyites

974
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,599
right

975
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,839
someone that reveres crowley puts him up

976
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:03,440
on a pedestal

977
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,320
you know, looks up to him, glorifies

978
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,119
him - bad idea

979
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,680
the man himself fell from the spiritual

980
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,720
path

981
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,720
and was not living according to the

982
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,839
principles and philosophy of true

983
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,240
thelema and the true thelemic philosophy

984
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,280
absolutely not

985
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,040
i don't tell you to put me up on a

986
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,920
pedestal and revere and glorify me

987
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,359
i'm not interested in that, i could care

988
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:30,720
less

989
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,560
i want you to understand natural law

990
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,160
that's what all the occult traditions

991
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,400
are there to help you do

992
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,079
they're there as a system of

993
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,680
correspondences, a system of allegories

994
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,680
a system of

995
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,720
general

996
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,960
guidance and teachings to help to

997
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,760
understand natural law, how it works and

998
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,920
to bring one's behavior into accordance

999
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,680
with it

1000
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,680
in such a way that we

1001
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,720
desist in continuing to create

1002
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,040
self-inflicted suffering for ourselves

1003
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,160
and others

1004
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,119
as is said in the

1005
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,480
thelemic philosophy

1006
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,040
"there is no god but man", and that doesn't

1007
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,720
mean that there's not a god of creation

1008
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,560
that created the universe and the laws

1009
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,200
of creation and set the laws of creation

1010
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,760
into effect - there is no small "g"-god

1011
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,720
except capital "m"-man

1012
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,400
what does that mean ?

1013
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,680
we're actually going to talk about that

1014
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,680
later today when i break down the

1015
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,920
document liber oz, which i will be doing

1016
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,760
on this show

1017
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,079
it's the seminal text of thelema and

1018
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:40,000
it's the culmination of thelema

1019
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,920
quite frankly - we'll be getting to that

1020
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,960
later

1021
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,520
just as a prelude to that, you know, "there

1022
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,000
is no god but man" simply means we're the

1023
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,839
ones doing it to ourselves to our own

1024
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:50,960
behavior

1025
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,040
through the way we think, and through our

1026
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,800
behavior, that we put out into the world

1027
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,119
we're enslaving ourselves as a...

1028
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,079
in the aggregate as a species, humanity

1029
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:02,160
is doing that to humanity

1030
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,079
okay, you could talk all you want about

1031
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:06,320
yes, there may be external forces at work

1032
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,640
there may be non terrestrial forces at

1033
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,480
work, i'm not going to dismiss that, i'm

1034
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,000
the last person that's going to dismiss

1035
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,920
that, and treat that like some kooky

1036
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,680
conspiracy theory

1037
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,480
i believe there has been

1038
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,560
absolute

1039
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,400
intervention, i'm sorry, not even

1040
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,200
intervention, but interference with the

1041
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,680
natural progression of human evolution

1042
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,960
on this planet by perhaps

1043
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:33,200
non-terrestrial, non-human entities

1044
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,280
we talked about that, we've speculated on

1045
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,880
that a lot here on what on earth is

1046
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,200
happening, i don't dismiss those theories

1047
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,599
at all, there's quite frankly lots of

1048
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:42,800
evidence

1049
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,200
available in human history to back it up

1050
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,480
to back up those theories

1051
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,520
however

1052
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,200
what i will say is

1053
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,359
it doesn't even matter

1054
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,119
it doesn't matter, because if we put our

1055
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,119
intent and our behavior

1056
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:00,720
into alignment with the true will of

1057
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,240
creation

1058
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,800
mighty forces come to our assistance

1059
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,000
and then we learn what not to do

1060
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
we learn what to do, we learn what not to

1061
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,359
do, and then we become intelligent in

1062
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:15,359
the way that we stop creating that

1063
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:16,880
self-inflicted suffering, and we're no

1064
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,520
longer doing it to ourselves, there's no

1065
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,319
small "g"-god, creator of the human

1066
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:26,800
experience, except capital "m"-man - mankind

1067
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,119
humankind, all of humanity in the

1068
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:32,160
aggregate is creating those experiences

1069
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,839
through our behavior that we put out

1070
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:35,839
into the universe, and then natural law

1071
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:38,160
brings the consequences to us that then

1072
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,599
we must live with in the aggregate

1073
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:43,520
shared reality that we call the

1074
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,359
human experience, that we call the human

1075
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:46,560
condition

1076
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,599
it's very simple, quite frankly, it makes

1077
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:53,920
very much perfect sense, quite frankly

1078
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,920
people will insist because of all the

1079
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,760
language that is used they don't like it

1080
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,000
{well, oh, well}

1081
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,760
you know, there's only so many words to

1082
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,400
describe certain concepts in the world

1083
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,520
and people

1084
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,000
put that together in often coded systems

1085
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,040
and

1086
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,400
allow people to

1087
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,240
try to decode it using their mental

1088
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,680
effort and will, and that's part of what

1089
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,680
thelema is all about

1090
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,520
taking that very same tradition from

1091
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,280
kabbalah and freemasonry, and tarot, and

1092
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,319
rosicrucianism, and other occult

1093
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:24,960
traditions

1094
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:28,800
so, crowley's own view in his writings of

1095
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,240
what he called the holy guardian angel

1096
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,520
is

1097
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,760
a deeper connection to the higher self

1098
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,240
which guides us on the path of the true

1099
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,280
will

1100
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,359
it guides us to toward

1101
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:44,720
our real and true purpose in life, that

1102
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,520
will lead to our maximum benefit and our

1103
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,359
maximum freedom

1104
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:52,079
and that then puts us on the path

1105
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:56,000
to maximum efficiency in our

1106
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,079
journey of evolution

1107
00:41:58,079 --> 00:41:59,599
in

1108
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:03,520
the universe, in creation

1109
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,760
in order for the holy guardian angel to

1110
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,839
manifest, to come forward, to make its

1111
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:09,839
presence felt in our life

1112
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:12,880
according to the thelemic tradition

1113
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,839
we first have to quiet the mind and

1114
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:17,440
folks, this is what i've been really

1115
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,280
coming back to this, over and over again

1116
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,040
folks, it...

1117
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,599
it warrants belaboring upon this point

1118
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,359
you see, the...

1119
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:27,200
the symbology of this

1120
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,280
you know, the all-seeing eye of the

1121
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,760
creator, the kundalini energy of the

1122
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,760
serpent coming up the spine and opening

1123
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,800
up the crown chakra, the angel's wings

1124
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,720
allowing us to truly come into harmony

1125
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,440
with natural law as a higher level force

1126
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,720
and then

1127
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,760
serve that law, truly align our behavior

1128
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,040
to it

1129
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,119
the symbology is fantastic in and of

1130
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:50,560
itself, some people will look at that and

1131
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,480
go - oh, that's dark occult, that's satanism -

1132
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,839
no, it isn't

1133
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:56,400
that's positive occult symbology

1134
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,280
you know

1135
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,640
again, ma'at's wings on the "lex rex" shirt

1136
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,640
you know, the justice card of the

1137
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,760
tarot

1138
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,920
you know, the "lex rex", "the law is king"

1139
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,000
these are all symbols of natural law

1140
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,319
it's the exact same thing here with the

1141
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:14,240
symbolism of the holy guardian angel and

1142
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,720
thelema, and, again, this isn't

1143
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,880
official symbolism, it's some, you know

1144
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,640
thelemites come up with different

1145
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,880
symbolic concepts to represent certain

1146
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,319
things

1147
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:25,599
however, i think this is highly

1148
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:27,440
appropriate symbolism representing

1149
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,440
kundalini energy of awakening

1150
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,720
representing the third eye coming online

1151
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,000
in the, you know, third eye chakra

1152
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,319
the mind awakening to higher level

1153
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:40,400
understanding of natural law, and, again

1154
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,400
that being a reflection of the creator's

1155
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,200
light coming into the world

1156
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,079
the all-seeing eye of the creator

1157
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:50,000
and its laws

1158
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,240
and then, again, the wings of the guardian

1159
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,119
angel

1160
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:55,119
providing protection, if one is on that

1161
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:57,760
path and stays upon it

1162
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,520
fulfilling the purpose, fulfilling the

1163
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,319
higher will of creation, getting in touch

1164
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:03,280
with that

1165
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,599
force of law

1166
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:08,240
and the force which moves us forward

1167
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,800
evolutionarily, that is the very force of

1168
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,040
evolution itself that fights against the

1169
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:16,240
involutionary force, that grindstone, that

1170
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,359
sharpens

1171
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:20,720
the blade of the practitioner, you know

1172
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,560
there has to be something pushing back a

1173
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,599
force that one has to sort of

1174
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:28,160
put its will against

1175
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,240
in order to move forward, in order to

1176
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,720
self-direct one's evolutionary progress

1177
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:38,720
as that small "g" creator, not capital "g"-god - small "g"-god

1178
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,720
creator, okay

1179
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,760
again

1180
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,359
in that sense

1181
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:44,800
there is no

1182
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,640
external force

1183
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,560
truly directing our evolution, but

1184
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,400
ourselves, in the aggregate sense, right

1185
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,760
now

1186
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,000
biological evolution got us up to this

1187
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,480
point, now it's up to our mental effort

1188
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,720
and will to push our epigenetic

1189
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:01,839
evolution forward against the entropic

1190
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:04,400
or involutionary force that's trying to

1191
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,640
stop that from happening, and that is the

1192
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,000
dark occult

1193
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,119
and that is

1194
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:09,920
you know

1195
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,280
potentially

1196
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,200
other forces at work that want to

1197
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,480
subvert our evolutionary progress

1198
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,200
crowley and thelemites look at

1199
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,800
getting in touch with

1200
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,160
the true will as bringing forward the

1201
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,640
evolutionary force of creation to assist

1202
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,839
us

1203
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:29,200
it would be putting ourselves in the

1204
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,920
position of the hangman card on the

1205
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,560
tarot, which sits at the right hand side

1206
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,319
of the justice card

1207
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:39,440
the king of creation, natural law itself

1208
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:43,119
and the hangman card would be

1209
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:44,839
the servant of natural

1210
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:47,920
law, and that is when the holy guardian

1211
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,680
angel expresses itself in thelemic terms

1212
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,839
but for it to

1213
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:56,319
come forward and present itself to us in

1214
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:59,440
our lives, as a protective influence, as a

1215
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,440
productive guiding force

1216
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,440
we first have to quiet the chatter of

1217
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,040
our mind, again, i've been

1218
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,760
hammering on this week, after week, after

1219
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,800
week

1220
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,960
you have to close the yapping of the

1221
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,440
mind, you have to learn techniques, this

1222
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,400
is why

1223
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,800
meditative techniques

1224
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,200
yogic techniques

1225
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,040
techniques to

1226
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,200
gain mastery over

1227
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,359
the noise of the mind

1228
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:27,680
which is so pervasive in the modern

1229
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,520
world

1230
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,520
how to quiet external forces that are

1231
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,160
constantly competing for your attention

1232
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,440
how many of us

1233
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,800
take the time to

1234
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,839
create space and silence, not have the

1235
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:41,440
phone constantly ringing and text

1236
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,760
messaging constantly going, not

1237
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,400
constantly sitting in front of a screen

1238
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,280
quieting the mind to get the voice

1239
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,720
of intuition

1240
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,319
and the voice of guidance that is

1241
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:54,560
speaking all the time to us, but it never

1242
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,040
speaks above a low whisper

1243
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,880
it's up to us to quiet

1244
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,880
the chatter of our minds and that's

1245
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,720
where practices of the thelemic

1246
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,680
tradition come into play

1247
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,520
that teach us those techniques for how

1248
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,040
to do that

1249
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,000
often learning can be inhibited, i talk

1250
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,319
about this constantly, you're not in a

1251
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:16,880
position to truly learn, if the mind is

1252
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,359
constantly chattering and yapping

1253
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:21,599
it makes it almost impossible, that's the

1254
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:22,559
ego

1255
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:24,880
saying - i want to speak, i want to be

1256
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,400
right, i don't want to listen, i don't

1257
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,000
want to truly learn, i want to, i want to

1258
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,160
be the one talking

1259
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:33,440
see, at some point

1260
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:37,599
what you have to do is simply stop

1261
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:39,920
part of the teachings of how to become

1262
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,839
the true media - one of the main things

1263
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:43,760
that we talk about

1264
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,839
the very first concept that we teach is

1265
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:48,319
the concept is king

1266
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:50,240
forget tasks

1267
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,400
forget the task, right, if you don't

1268
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,240
understand the why, if you don't

1269
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,559
understand what you're trying to do

1270
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:58,559
if you don't understand how you're going

1271
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:00,720
to go about doing it, right

1272
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:03,280
forget the task, right, the task is part

1273
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,960
of the how, not going to say it's

1274
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,680
unimportant, but if you don't understand

1275
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,200
conceptually

1276
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,359
what you are attempting to put forth and

1277
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:13,359
actually accomplish and do

1278
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:15,920
and the sub series of tasks on how

1279
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,880
to get there, right, because there's... it's

1280
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,960
chunking of knowledge, and the occult

1281
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,760
does this all the time, it's a direct

1282
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,119
correlation

1283
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:28,079
between the world of occultism and

1284
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:30,480
learning the technology to do this, and

1285
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,800
that's why many occult practitioners, who

1286
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,119
don't really truly understand technology

1287
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:37,200
or truly work with it, are missing a

1288
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,559
gigantic, gigantic aspect of the occult

1289
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:43,359
world and its teachings, and conversely

1290
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:44,960
many people who are involved in

1291
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,280
technology and have no understanding of

1292
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,800
the occult, and that's most people in the

1293
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,240
tech world

1294
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,480
also are missing tons and tons of

1295
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,359
correlations about how technology really

1296
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:57,200
works, that you could more deeply

1297
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,359
understand and gain a better foothold

1298
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:00,720
and a more efficient approach to

1299
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,440
technology if you study occultism, in

1300
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,839
conjunction with the tech world, you

1301
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:07,040
would be

1302
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,800
amazed

1303
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,240
at how completely together these

1304
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,839
two seemingly

1305
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:16,640
disparate and separate worlds truly go

1306
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,200
and how they mesh and almost operate as

1307
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,640
one unit

1308
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,040
and the occultists know this, that's why

1309
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,000
they're

1310
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,480
technocrats, folks, it's not an accident

1311
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,559
that's... that's on purpose

1312
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:30,319
that's not accidental, it doesn't just

1313
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:32,800
work out that way, okay, they are

1314
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,960
deliberately using technology, because

1315
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,960
technology is part of the driving force

1316
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,319
of the will

1317
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:43,040
but, is it serving the true will ? or is it

1318
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,960
serving the selfish will ? the dark

1319
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,720
occultists are using it to control and

1320
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,000
manipulate

1321
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,440
technology, techno-logos, technos

1322
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:55,040
logos, "technos" means "hand" in greek, "logos"

1323
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,960
means "word"

1324
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,359
it is the ability to put out the word

1325
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:02,000
through the hand, or through

1326
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,680
technical means

1327
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,160
you see, so, that is what the dark occult

1328
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,480
are doing they are putting out their

1329
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,079
word, their lies, their disinformation

1330
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:14,559
their action at a distance influenced

1331
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:16,960
to the detriment of humanity, through

1332
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,440
technology, and they got a big head start

1333
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,920
on us, folks, they've had the mind control

1334
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,920
device in every house, pumping the

1335
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,400
frequency of mind control into the brain

1336
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,480
since we were... since we popped out of the

1337
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,920
womb, since we were in the damn womb

1338
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,599
you don't think that these people, these

1339
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:36,160
technocratic elites, these technocratic

1340
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,559
dark occult psychopaths know this ? you

1341
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:40,319
don't think they understand all these

1342
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:42,319
correlations ? of course, they understand

1343
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:43,839
it, because they know the occult, and most

1344
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:46,319
of us don't, and most of us still think

1345
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:48,640
all of this is just darkness, all of this

1346
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,559
is just satanism, all of this is just

1347
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:54,960
something we should have no knowledge of

1348
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,319
they're beating our asses mercilessly

1349
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:00,400
because we don't know this stuff, and

1350
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,559
because we don't take it seriously, and

1351
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,640
because we don't put it into practice

1352
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,720
and because we're not putting our will

1353
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,200
behind it and putting our effort into

1354
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,880
learning the technology to spread the

1355
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,480
word through the actions of our hands

1356
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,880
and technology

1357
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,480
this is what the whole

1358
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,559
true media seminar is coming together as

1359
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:20,720
a culmination of my work to help teach

1360
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:23,119
people how to do, and the people who have

1361
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:25,599
learned it, man, you guys are impressive

1362
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:28,160
and you're doing a fantastic job

1363
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,839
for the people who are still

1364
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:32,160
slacking and you're way behind -

1365
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,839
you need to understand the importance of

1366
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:35,200
it

1367
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,920
and this is part of what quiet the damn

1368
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,319
chatter of the mind, you gotta learn the

1369
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:42,079
techniques in

1370
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:45,599
meditative tradition, in things like eft

1371
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:47,040
in things like

1372
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,359
you know

1373
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:52,960
yoga, true yoga

1374
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,240
in things like shadow work, and i'm

1375
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:59,200
talking about real shadow work, heart

1376
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,960
based shadow work, sitting in the in

1377
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,200
front of the mirror, not new age woo-woo

1378
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,200
stuff

1379
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,359
real

1380
00:52:06,359 --> 00:52:08,240
self-transformative, trans-personal

1381
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,559
techniques

1382
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:12,640
they do teach this in the thelemite

1383
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,640
tradition and other occult traditions

1384
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:18,680
and it's important to learn them

1385
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:21,520
it really goes back to

1386
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,359
what i taught about the very beginning

1387
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:27,040
of the natural law seminar, to be honest

1388
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:30,880
i started out teaching that seminar

1389
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,040
talking about teachability, the

1390
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,319
teachability index of the student

1391
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,319
of the one receiving the information, and

1392
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:39,359
again

1393
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:42,319
this directly correlates with thelema, if

1394
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:44,480
you understand what crowley was

1395
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,960
attempting to do with the writings, and

1396
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,640
how he was setting up systems of

1397
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:51,040
correspondences, and systems of

1398
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,040
correlative thinking which i talk about

1399
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,440
in demystifying the occult

1400
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,599
part one and two

1401
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:00,079
correlative thinking is so important in

1402
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:03,200
expanding consciousness

1403
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:06,160
it will literally take your iq points up

1404
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,480
several points, that is how important

1405
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:12,000
understanding correlative thinking is

1406
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,440
i could see this

1407
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,599
symbolic image here on the slide, and

1408
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:16,960
immediately

1409
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,559
go into

1410
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:21,520
an essay on all of the things

1411
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:24,079
symbolically and correlatively

1412
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:26,160
and allegorically that the symbolism

1413
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,480
means in human life, and other people sit

1414
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:29,760
there and go

1415
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,280
snake-wing-eye - snake, wings and eye

1416
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,800
in a triangle

1417
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,280
what's that ?

1418
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:42,000
they have no correlative thinking skills

1419
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,400
don't even understand

1420
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,480
the importance of being able to relate

1421
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,880
symbolism, the symbolism to conceptual

1422
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,839
ideas, and how these occultists have been

1423
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:53,359
using this for thousands of years to

1424
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:55,680
communicate with each other and to

1425
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,000
subvert us, to use the symbolism in a

1426
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,880
subversive way, to make us think a

1427
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,079
certain way

1428
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:04,720
so, then we go into their manipulation

1429
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,480
and we fall under their

1430
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,960
influence, and we fall under their

1431
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,720
thrall, their mind control

1432
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,000
again, we could

1433
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,760
hearken back to the idea of betty

1434
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,960
crocker's cake, right

1435
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,800
betty crocker comes up with instant cake

1436
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,040
mix in the 50s, housewives don't want it

1437
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,920
they don't buy it, it's a failing product

1438
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,559
they go to madison avenue psychologists

1439
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:30,720
campaign execs to understand occult

1440
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:34,240
archetypes and occult conceptual ideas

1441
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,400
and they say they're feeling guilty

1442
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,559
they're not putting any effort and love

1443
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:40,799
from themselves, from their own effort

1444
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:42,960
into the making of the cake from scratch

1445
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:45,280
for their own beloved family members, and

1446
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,960
then they're feeling guilty

1447
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,720
they don't want the quick answer, they

1448
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,040
want to put their creative energy into

1449
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,280
the work and make something of true

1450
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,480
value for their family

1451
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,640
so, what...

1452
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,559
campaign, the advertising campaign

1453
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:02,720
executives come back with for betty

1454
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:03,839
crocker

1455
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:05,760
don't change your cake mix

1456
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,200
don't come up with something they really

1457
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,599
want, we'll psychologically make them want

1458
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:10,880
it for you

1459
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,280
add the instructions to the box "add an

1460
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,880
egg"

1461
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,960
archetypally the egg is the feminine

1462
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,079
essence

1463
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:20,079
the oval of the egg is the feminine

1464
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:21,040
essence

1465
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:22,079
right

1466
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:23,680
and therefore

1467
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,440
by proxy

1468
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:28,160
by psychological proxy, by putting the

1469
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,400
egg into the cake mix, the woman is

1470
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:35,520
inserting her own feminine energy aspect

1471
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:39,599
the creative aspect of the feminine, into

1472
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:41,280
then the product

1473
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,440
and that assuages the guilt of not

1474
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,119
providing that

1475
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:47,440
creative essence for her family, because

1476
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,040
she's giving the very

1477
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:52,240
archetypal creative symbolic essence of

1478
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,559
the female - the egg

1479
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:56,720
to the family members then

1480
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,400
and therefore that makes it okay, and

1481
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,880
that assuages the guilt, and then

1482
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,359
cake mix flew off the shelves - that's the

1483
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:04,559
occult

1484
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:06,400
that is the world of occultism, ladies

1485
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:07,760
and gentlemen

1486
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:08,799
you know

1487
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:09,520
not

1488
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:13,040
doing bonfires and throwing animals

1489
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,440
onto the bonfire out in the woods, in

1490
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:16,960
the clearing in the woods - that's not

1491
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:19,440
satanism - you could say, some satanist

1492
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,440
will do practices like that, but let me

1493
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:24,640
tell you something - the vast majority are

1494
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:28,160
at work at a very high deep fundamental

1495
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:29,040
level

1496
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,400
of doing things like

1497
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,160
making people want to buy products, that

1498
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:34,559
they don't really need or want

1499
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:36,000
rather than going out of the woods and

1500
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,720
sacrificing animals

1501
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,960
they're formulating

1502
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,960
whole strategies to get the population

1503
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,200
to cull itself

1504
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,280
by buying into a whole bunch of fucking

1505
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:48,480
nonsense

1506
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:49,920
and things that aren't true that the

1507
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,720
media is repeating over and over again

1508
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,200
as a mind control technique

1509
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,880
and then for people to go and take

1510
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,559
poison

1511
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:00,799
that's a biological

1512
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:02,480
culling agent

1513
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:03,520
you know

1514
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:04,240
and

1515
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:06,480
the occultists are very much at work on

1516
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,920
that type of mental influence

1517
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:12,960
that's real magic

1518
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,799
that's their sorcery, but, believe me

1519
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:18,240
that's magic, that's action at a distance

1520
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:20,000
you know, they're providing that, they're

1521
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
conducting that level of sorcery at a

1522
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,200
distance

1523
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:26,160
and it's working brilliantly on the vast

1524
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:28,240
majority of the population

1525
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:32,240
so, quieting the mind through techniques

1526
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,960
is the first step of truly becoming a

1527
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:38,000
student of natural law, of

1528
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,280
computing

1529
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,520
of the occult world

1530
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,760
you gotta be honest with yourself

1531
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,880
stop lying to yourself, and you gotta

1532
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,559
ultra...

1533
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:51,280
ultimately, i'm sorry, learn how to think

1534
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,440
and that involves receiving those

1535
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,000
methods, receiving the methods of

1536
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,680
efficient

1537
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:59,839
learning

1538
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:01,200
this is what we're going to teach in "how

1539
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,359
to become the true media"

1540
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:05,440
you have to be able

1541
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,240
to quiet your mind and stop thinking

1542
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:10,000
according to the terms you may have been

1543
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:10,960
thinking

1544
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,280
empty the mind of what came before - this

1545
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:16,400
is valid in martial arts, as well

1546
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,319
if people have learned bad techniques in

1547
00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:20,160
other martial arts - you really don't want

1548
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,839
them bringing techniques into a more

1549
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:24,079
efficient way of teaching something, for

1550
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:27,200
instance, g-kundo, bruce lee's system

1551
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,200
his system-less system...

1552
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,280
his formless system

1553
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:32,240
his

1554
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,559
free-flowing art

1555
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:36,559
of martial arts

1556
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:39,359
the first form of mma

1557
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:40,880
he would rather have somebody come with

1558
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,960
an empty slate mind

1559
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,119
with no previous knowledge of how they

1560
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,880
did things, because then the mind's

1561
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:48,319
shattering when he's showing them a

1562
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:49,280
technique

1563
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,040
they're like - "i learned a different way, i

1564
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:52,640
learned a different way, i learned how to

1565
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:54,640
do it this way, and the other school that

1566
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:56,160
i went to"

1567
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:58,079
and he's trying to show them

1568
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:00,160
"i've already been there done that, it's

1569
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,880
inefficient, it doesn't truly really work

1570
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,599
it may work in some instances, but if you

1571
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:08,400
want the fastest route to getting out of

1572
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,000
problems, if you want the fastest route

1573
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,599
to putting down your opponent, if you

1574
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:13,280
want the most efficient route to

1575
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:14,799
protecting your life and then getting

1576
00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:16,480
out of there - you got to learn my

1577
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,000
technique, because i've studied it, and

1578
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,880
i've compared and contrasted over a lot

1579
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,480
of time, and a lot of different

1580
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,160
techniques - all of these different

1581
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,079
methods, and i've arrived at the most

1582
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:28,000
efficient in my experience and in my

1583
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,920
knowledge"

1584
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:32,079
and that's why at some point you got to

1585
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:34,319
extend a little bit of trust - this is

1586
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:36,400
what the holy guardian angel is about

1587
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,559
you quiet the mind, you extend trust to

1588
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:39,680
creation

1589
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,760
right, it's one thing to extend trust to

1590
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,599
a teacher in the physical world, you

1591
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:45,119
could extend trust to me in teaching

1592
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:46,960
natural law, you could extend trust in

1593
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:49,119
teaching technology, you could extend

1594
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:51,040
trust to people who had considered

1595
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,359
themselves adepts in occult traditions

1596
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:56,160
that's obviously, that's a matter of

1597
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:59,200
you know, human dynamics, but ultimately

1598
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,280
what we're really doing is we're opening

1599
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:04,000
up and allowing through the quieting of

1600
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,640
the mind reception of natural law into

1601
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,640
the self - this is what kabbalah is, that's

1602
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:11,119
why kabbalah is such a huge important

1603
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:12,720
part of thelema

1604
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:16,000
it's one of the integral traditions that

1605
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,839
helped formulate and influence thelema

1606
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:21,920
the word "kabbalah" literally means "to

1607
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:24,799
receive", it is a verb in ancient hebrew

1608
01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:26,960
"kabbalah" is the verb in ancient hebrew

1609
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:28,400
that means "to

1610
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:31,119
receive", it's an infinitive

1611
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:33,920
like in latin there are infinitive verbs

1612
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,680
you know

1613
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:38,160
"habere" means to have

1614
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:42,240
you know

1615
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:46,559
"dictare", the infinitive - "to speak"

1616
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:50,640
"ocultare" means "to hide, to conceal,

1617
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:53,359
to keep secret"

1618
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:55,599
that's the infinitive form - "kabbalah", you

1619
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:58,319
could look at in ancient hebrew as it is

1620
01:00:58,319 --> 01:01:01,440
an infinitive form of the verb

1621
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:03,200
"to receive"

1622
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:06,640
and kabbalah teaches proper reception

1623
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,079
it means

1624
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:10,640
"preparing the mind

1625
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:13,520
in an efficient way to receive the

1626
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:15,200
knowledge of natural law, of the

1627
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:18,079
creator's laws"

1628
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:19,359
thelema

1629
01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:21,040
is doing

1630
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:23,119
the same thing, it's no different in that

1631
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:27,680
regard, and the idea of preparing oneself

1632
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:30,160
for the reception of the influence of

1633
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:31,599
the holy guardian angel, of the

1634
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:34,160
protection of the holy guardian angel, is

1635
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:36,799
the techniques of quieting the ego

1636
01:01:36,799 --> 01:01:38,880
quieting the chatter, the endless chatter

1637
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:41,280
of the ego

1638
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,040
so, for this

1639
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,319
influence

1640
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:45,200
this

1641
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:46,079
force

1642
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:48,960
to make its presence known in your life

1643
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,720
you don't have to see this as a personal

1644
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:53,680
force, and i don't, and most thelemites do

1645
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:54,880
not

1646
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:57,359
it's not a personal force, it's not an

1647
01:01:57,359 --> 01:02:00,559
actual angel, right, it's not an actual

1648
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:02,319
entity

1649
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:05,280
it's a form of energy

1650
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,280
that's what all of the occult ultimately

1651
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,200
is teaching us - how to work with energies

1652
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,520
within creation

1653
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,599
if we really break them down

1654
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:14,720
how do you

1655
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:16,960
energize the mind, how do you change the

1656
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:19,200
energy of the mind - that's magic

1657
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,880
how do you get someone that was ultra

1658
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,160
resistant

1659
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:24,880
to now listen to the voice of wisdom and

1660
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,319
reason and take the truth into

1661
01:02:26,319 --> 01:02:27,839
themselves, and then start teaching it

1662
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:29,680
themselves - there's no greater form of

1663
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:32,000
magick than that

1664
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,839
how many people, do you think, maybe i

1665
01:02:33,839 --> 01:02:35,920
helped influence to do that

1666
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,839
obviously they do that work ultimately

1667
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:40,480
to themselves, but did i influence that ?

1668
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,400
yes, that's magick

1669
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:45,440
i helped influence that, i helped prepare

1670
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:48,079
that way - you can do the same thing if

1671
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:50,240
you take it seriously enough, that's what

1672
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:52,640
doing the will is

1673
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:54,960
and a lot of thelemites don't know this

1674
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:56,559
that's the sad part

1675
01:02:56,559 --> 01:02:58,799
the sad part is - i'm going to

1676
01:02:58,799 --> 01:03:00,400
teach people more about what real

1677
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:03,200
thelema is in 2

1678
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:06,160
podcasts and 2 video episodes

1679
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:08,960
podcast-episodes, than in probably all

1680
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:11,280
the years that they ever studied thelema

1681
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:12,480
in a few

1682
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:15,599
broad... audio broadcasts with some images

1683
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:17,920
freemasons wrote me and told me - "you

1684
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:20,480
taught me more about freemasonry than my

1685
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:21,760
20

1686
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:22,559
plus

1687
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:26,720
years in my lodge system, that i've been

1688
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:29,280
attending for over 20 years - i did not

1689
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,839
understand this, this knowledge, this

1690
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:32,799
truth

1691
01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:36,319
did not enter me, i didn't receive it in

1692
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:40,559
20 plus years in the lodge system of

1693
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:42,079
freemasonry"

1694
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:44,160
and, once again

1695
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:46,079
some people have understood exactly what

1696
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:47,039
i said

1697
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:49,039
last week, and some people don't

1698
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:51,119
understand what i'm saying

1699
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:53,839
i asked...

1700
01:03:53,839 --> 01:03:55,520
let me finish this slide and then i'll

1701
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:57,280
reiterate that, because i want to go over

1702
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:59,359
it again, and i want the offer out on the

1703
01:03:59,359 --> 01:04:01,520
table in a clearly understood way

1704
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,039
because i... there's still people that

1705
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:04,799
don't understand what i asked for last

1706
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:07,839
week - i made a request last week

1707
01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:10,000
about the lodge system of freemasonry

1708
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,319
because of how connected this topic is

1709
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:14,000
actually with freemasonry - a lot of the

1710
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,160
rituals are connected to it, a lot of the

1711
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:18,160
practices are connected to it, much of

1712
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:21,200
the symbolism is very connected to it

1713
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:23,200
so, i'm going to repeat my request after

1714
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:25,200
i finish with this slide

1715
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:28,319
because it bears repeating, it's worth

1716
01:04:28,319 --> 01:04:31,520
belaboring it and repeating it

1717
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:33,599
so

1718
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:36,319
until we quiet the mind and we really

1719
01:04:36,319 --> 01:04:38,240
listen to the wisdom

1720
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:40,640
of the force of creation, that's always

1721
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,319
speaking to us, but it doesn't raise its

1722
01:04:42,319 --> 01:04:44,319
voice - it's not like mark passio when he

1723
01:04:44,319 --> 01:04:46,480
gets angry about the order followers

1724
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:48,480
okay, it's not going to scream into the

1725
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:50,000
camera, right

1726
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,799
okay, that's me and my 3-D body getting

1727
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:54,000
angry at people who still don't

1728
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,480
understand, right

1729
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:59,119
and i'll raise my voice make it

1730
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:02,640
very very very very unambiguously clear

1731
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,799
creation doesn't do that, the first of

1732
01:05:04,799 --> 01:05:07,280
all doesn't need to, because it is the

1733
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:10,559
truth, i'm expressing the truth, i am not

1734
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:13,359
the truth, creation itself is the actual

1735
01:05:13,359 --> 01:05:15,359
truth, right, it doesn't need to do

1736
01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:18,000
anything, because it's what is - period - it

1737
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,200
doesn't care whether you don't

1738
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:20,960
understand, it doesn't need to care

1739
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:22,640
whether you don't understand

1740
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:24,559
it's law

1741
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:27,280
law is unwavering, unbreakable, operates

1742
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:29,599
100 flawlessly a certain way, like a

1743
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:31,680
computer program, and it doesn't give a

1744
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,920
damn whether you don't understand it

1745
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:35,440
it is there

1746
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:37,440
operating on cue

1747
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:39,760
to provide you the learning experience

1748
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:42,000
that it could go smoothly, or you could

1749
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,559
choose the way of maximum pain

1750
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:46,160
if you want to choose that - that's up to

1751
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:48,160
you, that's your free will choice

1752
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:49,680
i think it's pretty stupid thing to

1753
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,680
choose, but most people on this planet

1754
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:54,480
are choosing exactly that

1755
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,559
if, on the other hand, we learned the

1756
01:05:56,559 --> 01:05:58,880
techniques of quieting the mind

1757
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:01,760
through meditation, through yoga, through

1758
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:04,160
traumatic healing practices and shadow

1759
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:06,000
work etcetera

1760
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,400
then we learn to listen to this voice of

1761
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:09,680
wisdom

1762
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:12,000
it quiets the ego, the chatter of the ego

1763
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,480
that's incessant, it's non-stop

1764
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:17,200
and that force of entropy and involution

1765
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,280
is always trying to take us off our true

1766
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:21,280
path, it's always trying to get us not to

1767
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:22,960
do the true will

1768
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:24,880
it's taking us off the path of wisdom

1769
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,720
and the path of the true will, and then

1770
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:29,039
what happens - we talked about that last

1771
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:30,720
week - when we're not on the path of true

1772
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:33,440
will - maximum resistance comes to us in

1773
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:35,920
our lives, our lives become

1774
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:39,440
harder, it becomes...

1775
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:42,000
things are put as obstacles in our path

1776
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,480
because we're not on the right path, and

1777
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:46,480
the universe puts obstacles in our path

1778
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,240
to try to nudge us back onto the right

1779
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:49,359
path

1780
01:06:49,359 --> 01:06:51,359
but as we become more calcified in the

1781
01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:53,280
ego, and more hard-headed, and less

1782
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:54,640
willing to listen to that voice of

1783
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:55,920
wisdom

1784
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:58,400
more and more obstacles arise, we go into

1785
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:01,119
total abject tyranny and slavery

1786
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:03,280
and that's where we're at, because of not

1787
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:05,200
listening to the voice of truth and

1788
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:08,160
insisting on constantly have that

1789
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:09,599
entropic

1790
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:11,680
voice of the ego, chattering away in the

1791
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:14,559
mind, so, that it takes us off

1792
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:15,359
the

1793
01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:17,680
place where we are in a maximum position

1794
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:18,880
to learn

1795
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,960
to receive

1796
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:24,839
to learn and to grow

1797
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,640
so, the holy guardian angel is the

1798
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:32,480
energetic pathway

1799
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:33,280
of

1800
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:35,520
listening to the voice of wisdom

1801
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:38,400
aligning our behavior to the true will

1802
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,319
getting on that true will, aligning our

1803
01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:41,599
behavior to it

1804
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:44,000
and staying there as opposed to falling

1805
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,440
off the path, because

1806
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:47,680
our ego chatter becomes too incessant

1807
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:51,440
and we fall away from that path

1808
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:53,680
so, that's the entirety of the concept of

1809
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:55,760
the holy guardian angel

1810
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:58,240
crowley referred to his own

1811
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,599
energy

1812
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:01,680
spirit - whatever you want to call it, his

1813
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:05,599
own holy guardian angel aiwass

1814
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:10,000
whose name in greek gematria also adds

1815
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,559
up to the number 93

1816
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:15,760
so, again, in gematria terms if

1817
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:18,238
numerologically the word adds up the

1818
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:19,759
letters of the word

1819
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:21,520
assigned numeral...

1820
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:24,719
numerological equivalence

1821
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:28,319
if the words add up to the same thing, it

1822
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:30,238
is taken to mean that they mean the same

1823
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:32,080
thing, they have the same meaning, so,

1824
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:34,319
"thelema" adds to 93

1825
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:36,880
"agape", which means "love" - "thelema" means

1826
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:40,799
"will", "agape" means "love" - it adds in greek

1827
01:08:40,799 --> 01:08:44,238
gematria also to 93, aiwass

1828
01:08:44,238 --> 01:08:44,960
is

1829
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:47,439
a form of the holy guardian angel in

1830
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:50,960
thelema, that name adds to 93, so, they all

1831
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,640
mean the same thing

1832
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:54,560
higher will

1833
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:56,719
higher love-agape

1834
01:08:56,719 --> 01:08:58,960
the holy guardian angel - all

1835
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:00,960
interconnected, all ultimately meaning

1836
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:02,880
the same thing, being on the path of the

1837
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:06,000
true will, being on the path of evolution

1838
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,120
in creation, true evolution

1839
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:11,040
being on the path of alignment with

1840
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:13,759
natural law

1841
01:09:14,238 --> 01:09:16,399
so, let's move on to another concept in

1842
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:20,880
thalema which was "out" - o-u-t, getting out

1843
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:24,080
is a very important concept of freeing

1844
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,198
the mind

1845
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:28,399
getting the mind out of mind control

1846
01:09:28,399 --> 01:09:31,120
and this is why crowley emphasized this

1847
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:33,040
concept over and over again in his

1848
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:36,080
writings, that you had to get out

1849
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:37,679
that... this was

1850
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:40,719
an allegorical correlation to freeing

1851
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:43,520
oneself, getting out of a cage, right, if

1852
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:45,120
you're in a cage, you're under total

1853
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:47,198
control, you're behind bars

1854
01:09:47,198 --> 01:09:48,960
these are... this is the prison of

1855
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:50,479
the mind

1856
01:09:50,479 --> 01:09:53,040
that's what he was referring to with "out"

1857
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:54,480
but then, of course, this leads to

1858
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:56,000
physical freedom, because we're not only

1859
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,640
under the free... the prison of the mind

1860
01:09:58,640 --> 01:09:59,520
we're

1861
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:02,719
under duress of the body, we are

1862
01:10:02,719 --> 01:10:04,880
physically enslaved as well as mentally

1863
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:06,719
enslaved, and most people are spiritually

1864
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:08,960
enslaved

1865
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:11,199
so

1866
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:13,360
in

1867
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:17,199
some of his writings crowley referred to

1868
01:10:17,199 --> 01:10:20,159
what he called "the head cage"

1869
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:22,719
and this is literally having a mind that

1870
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:25,360
is completely controlled by

1871
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:28,320
religious concepts and cult-like

1872
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:31,199
concepts, erroneous cult-like

1873
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:32,640
brainwashing

1874
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:34,080
that people were

1875
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:35,520
clinging on to

1876
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,679
with religious fervor

1877
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:39,840
and because they were doing that

1878
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:41,679
they could not get on the path of the

1879
01:10:41,679 --> 01:10:42,719
true will

1880
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:44,640
they... it was that was the obstacle that

1881
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:47,440
was preventing them from aligning their

1882
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:49,280
behavior with the true will and serving

1883
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:52,000
it, so, let's give an example of this

1884
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,360
before we break down the... you know

1885
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:59,120
the lettering and the symbolism

1886
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:02,000
of getting out, of escape from mind

1887
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,560
control, and specifically the numerology

1888
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:07,600
of the number 23 to represent that, and

1889
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:09,440
{they} kind of made a movie about it, i

1890
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:11,440
think it was

1891
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:13,760
jim carrey in the movie, it's called the

1892
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:16,560
"number 23", where he has to

1893
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:18,400
wrestle with the wrong that he has did

1894
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,719
and stop lying to himself about it

1895
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:22,400
in a very

1896
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:25,199
diseased way

1897
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:27,199
and then when he does that, you know, it

1898
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:29,040
begins the process of healing his

1899
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:31,280
personal trauma

1900
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:33,520
pretty interesting movie from a symbolic

1901
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:36,239
an allegorical point of view

1902
01:11:36,239 --> 01:11:38,000
dealing with the concept of the number

1903
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,960
23 meaning "get out of mental bondage"

1904
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:43,440
if you watch the movie again in that

1905
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:45,199
allegorical light you'll see it

1906
01:11:45,199 --> 01:11:47,360
completely differently

1907
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:49,120
so...

1908
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:50,640
and it's also about not lying to

1909
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,320
yourself about what you've done that is

1910
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:53,679
harmful

1911
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:55,840
so,

1912
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:00,560
going back to this concept

1913
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:04,239
i

1914
01:12:04,239 --> 01:12:05,840
briefly lost my train of thought there

1915
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:07,199
about the

1916
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:09,280
thing that i wanted to explain

1917
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:12,159
about crowley... about jack parsons, so

1918
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:15,199
let's give the example of getting out

1919
01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:18,080
about jack parsons life, right, because

1920
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:20,159
if you read the books

1921
01:12:20,159 --> 01:12:21,600
strange angel

1922
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:23,760
or sex and rockets

1923
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:26,800
about jack parsons life, or if you watch

1924
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,360
the brilliantly put together period

1925
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,600
television piece called "strange angel"

1926
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:34,080
which was named after the book

1927
01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:37,840
you'll understand that

1928
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:40,239
especially early on in his exploration

1929
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:41,679
of thelema

1930
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:44,960
that jack parsons was very conflicted, he

1931
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:47,199
did not step upon the true will and

1932
01:12:47,199 --> 01:12:49,440
follow it himself either

1933
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:50,640
and

1934
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:52,560
many times he fell from the path of the

1935
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:53,600
will

1936
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:56,400
and would not listen to the influence of

1937
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:58,560
his guardian angel

1938
01:12:58,560 --> 01:12:59,440
and

1939
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:02,000
you know, or you could look at that as

1940
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,080
the higher self, the intuitive

1941
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:06,480
self, the intuitive force, the creative

1942
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:09,679
force, the imagination - many ways of

1943
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:12,000
looking at it, okay, but if you don't

1944
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,920
listen to that

1945
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:15,679
guidance system

1946
01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:17,600
which is ultimately

1947
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:19,600
heart-based intelligence

1948
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:22,640
which is ultimately conscience based

1949
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:24,400
if you don't listen to that

1950
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,960
obstacles arise, and you fall from

1951
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:29,120
your path, you're not

1952
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:30,960
operating in the true will, and i

1953
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:32,719
apologize for the noise, folks, it's

1954
01:13:32,719 --> 01:13:34,480
another warm day here in philly - i have

1955
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:36,640
the window open and the fan on, hopefully

1956
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:39,199
it's not too bad, badly distracting, but

1957
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:41,920
there is work going on right

1958
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:44,080
on the other side of this small street

1959
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:45,840
that i live on, so, i apologize if it

1960
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:47,520
comes through, it comes through

1961
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,920
we have to just deal with it make the best

1962
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:51,840
of it that we can, but, you know, it's

1963
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:54,000
just what it is

1964
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,800
but, going back to parsons

1965
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:59,840
you know, if you read about this

1966
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:02,239
struggle that he had in staying on the

1967
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:05,040
true will path in his life

1968
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:07,679
you could also get this from

1969
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:09,440
you know, this kind of

1970
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:10,640
you know, really

1971
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:15,640
struggle in his life to weed out

1972
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:17,840
inconsistencies in his own thoughts and

1973
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:19,040
behaviors

1974
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:20,640
in the

1975
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:23,199
television series "strange angel" they

1976
01:14:23,199 --> 01:14:25,199
explained that, you know, he's basically

1977
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:27,360
trying to serve two masters, right

1978
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:28,400
he's...

1979
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,080
he wants to get more involved in the

1980
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:32,159
philosophy of thelema and the occult

1981
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:34,640
tradition of thelema, he wants to lead

1982
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:37,360
the agape lodge, the agape lodge, really

1983
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:40,880
they say "agape" in a "strange angel"

1984
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:43,120
they pronounce many things wrong

1985
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:44,880
they say "thelima" when it should be

1986
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:47,360
pronounced "thelema", they say "agApe" when

1987
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:49,679
it should be "Agape"

1988
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:51,920
there's, you know, different

1989
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:54,560
you know, inflection points or emphasis

1990
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:55,920
that should be placed on certain

1991
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:59,040
syllables - the word "agape" is pronounced

1992
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:01,199
just as i just pronounced it - "Agape", it's

1993
01:15:01,199 --> 01:15:02,719
not "agApe"

1994
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:04,159
"Agape"

1995
01:15:04,159 --> 01:15:05,280
and then

1996
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:09,280
"thelema" is with a long "ei" sound in the

1997
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:13,440
second syllable - not "thelima"

1998
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:15,600
so

1999
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:18,080
regardless of that

2000
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:19,520
parsons

2001
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:21,920
is trying to get a job with

2002
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:25,360
the military, right, he wants to be

2003
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:27,199
you know, working in military

2004
01:15:27,199 --> 01:15:30,400
laboratories inventing

2005
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,320
rocket propulsion, jet propulsion and

2006
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:34,000
rocket propulsion

2007
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,520
and this is very much in conflict with

2008
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:39,679
the workings that he really is supposed

2009
01:15:39,679 --> 01:15:41,120
to be doing in

2010
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:44,080
the agape lodge system, and thelema in

2011
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:45,520
general

2012
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:47,600
and the show depicts that

2013
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:50,719
it's one of the actual reasons that

2014
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:52,640
the show went off the air

2015
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:55,679
they presented "liber oz" which i'm going

2016
01:15:55,679 --> 01:15:57,360
to read here today

2017
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:00,880
on network television, right, on cbs

2018
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:03,120
all access where this show aired

2019
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:05,440
and

2020
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:07,679
that was it after that

2021
01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:09,440
the show was canceled very shortly

2022
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:10,719
thereafter

2023
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:12,480
because they hit people with probably

2024
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:15,199
the culmination of the occult

2025
01:16:15,199 --> 01:16:17,520
world philosophically

2026
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:20,159
with "liber oz"

2027
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:22,239
and they show the conflict that this

2028
01:16:22,239 --> 01:16:24,719
was not only creating between the agape

2029
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:26,960
lodge and military members who had

2030
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:30,320
attended at parsons behest

2031
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:31,199
but

2032
01:16:31,199 --> 01:16:33,520
it shows the conflict that was going on

2033
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:36,080
inside parsons himself

2034
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:37,760
because he wanted this military

2035
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:39,360
contracting job

2036
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:41,120
which, you know, he eventually took and

2037
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:44,400
went on to form nasa, went on to be the

2038
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,560
in one of the influencers that formed

2039
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:47,600
nasa

2040
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:50,159
and

2041
01:16:50,159 --> 01:16:52,880
you know, that highly conflicted

2042
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:54,880
and contrasted

2043
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:58,800
with his role of doing the true will

2044
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,719
in the world of thelema and the thelemic

2045
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:04,159
philosophy

2046
01:17:04,159 --> 01:17:04,960
so

2047
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:09,040
parsons as a early thelemite

2048
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:13,199
absolutely also struggled with

2049
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:17,080
issues of

2050
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:19,600
contradiction

2051
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:20,960
where

2052
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:22,560
he was still

2053
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:24,800
walking in two worlds, not fully

2054
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:26,480
committing himself

2055
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:28,239
not fully putting his energy and effort

2056
01:17:28,239 --> 01:17:31,760
behind the thelemic principles, and still

2057
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:35,280
very much attached to the 3-D world and 3-D

2058
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:36,640
goals

2059
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:39,520
which i'm not saying you shouldn't do

2060
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:41,440
you should have goals in the 3-D world

2061
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:43,920
especially when it comes to true freedom

2062
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:45,280
but if you let

2063
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:46,960
worldly

2064
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:49,520
values, worldly judgments, worldly systems

2065
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:51,840
hold you back from your true will

2066
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:53,440
you're not going to succeed in either

2067
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:55,760
realm, you're not going to succeed in

2068
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:58,960
the world of true spirituality and the

2069
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:01,120
true occult philosophy

2070
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:03,040
nor are you going to succeed in the

2071
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:05,120
earthly world of having your true

2072
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:07,280
freedom and your true potential

2073
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:10,400
in the very real physical world

2074
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:12,880
so, i think the tv show "strange angel"

2075
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:14,800
does a very good job at portraying that

2076
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:16,960
especially in the later episodes of the

2077
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:18,320
second season

2078
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:20,000
showing that conflict that's going on

2079
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,640
internally in jack parsons mind

2080
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:24,880
and how he was not getting out

2081
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:26,880
he was not understanding the conceptual

2082
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:30,080
idea of release of the mind from its

2083
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:32,080
bars, from its prisons, and from serving

2084
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:34,640
to masters, and from inherent internal

2085
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:37,199
contradiction in the mind, and inherent

2086
01:18:37,199 --> 01:18:38,840
internal contradiction in one's

2087
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:41,440
behaviors, from what one knows one should

2088
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:44,239
be doing and aligning its behaviors to

2089
01:18:44,239 --> 01:18:46,480
the true will versus not doing that and

2090
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:48,560
staying keeping the behaviors in

2091
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:50,320
accordance with worldly comfort and

2092
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:52,480
worldly goals

2093
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:53,360
so

2094
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:55,040
you know, you can read those books or

2095
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:56,800
check out that television series which

2096
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,000
depicts it

2097
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,640
very brilliantly in a very accurate

2098
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:04,640
40s period piece, exceedingly well

2099
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:06,080
i was very disappointed that it was

2100
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:07,360
cancelled from

2101
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:08,960
television, because i was

2102
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:10,400
very interested in seeing how they were

2103
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:12,000
going to depict the relationship of

2104
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,360
parsons and

2105
01:19:14,239 --> 01:19:17,360
l ron hubbard - the show was cancelled

2106
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:19,520
on the episode, the last episode was

2107
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:21,760
elrond hubbard shows up to

2108
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:22,880
parsons

2109
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:25,679
home and he's going to enter the

2110
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:28,560
agape lodge, and that was the last

2111
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:30,400
episode - they canceled it after that

2112
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:31,679
because they don't want people really

2113
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:33,840
understanding thelema - when they got into

2114
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:35,360
the philosophy of it, you know, they're

2115
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:37,600
okay with showing parsons early life and

2116
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,440
his discovery of the lodge, they're fine

2117
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:41,760
with that, once liber oz was read - that

2118
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:43,679
was the end of that show, and everybody

2119
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:46,239
knows it, everybody who watched

2120
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:48,800
the seasons knows that's what did it

2121
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:50,480
in

2122
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:53,440
it's pretty blatant

2123
01:19:55,679 --> 01:19:58,719
so, this concept of

2124
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:00,719
getting out

2125
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:04,320
the "23 skidoo", as we talked about in the

2126
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:08,320
numerological section last week

2127
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:10,400
"23 skidoo" is this old

2128
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,880
20s and 30s phrase

2129
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:14,800
1920s and 30s

2130
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:16,400
it means "get out while the getting's

2131
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,239
good, make your quick exit, quick

2132
01:20:18,239 --> 01:20:19,360
escape",

2133
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:22,000
"ghost people", just...

2134
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,159
"scoot on out of there while you can"

2135
01:20:24,159 --> 01:20:25,760
especially if the situation is going to

2136
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:29,920
get uncomfortable, right, so, it's like...

2137
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:32,400
crowley and the thelemic tradition, it's

2138
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:34,320
telling you - get out of the mind control

2139
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:36,000
while you can, while the

2140
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,520
opportunity is available, while the

2141
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:39,840
information is here and available, before

2142
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:41,920
it gets even more draconian

2143
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:43,760
and then it's going to be infinitely

2144
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:45,679
more of a challenge, before there's more

2145
01:20:45,679 --> 01:20:46,800
censorship, and it's going to be

2146
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:48,639
infinitely more of a challenge, to get

2147
01:20:48,639 --> 01:20:50,639
out of that mental hypnosis, and that

2148
01:20:50,639 --> 01:20:52,880
mental trance, and thrall, and mind

2149
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:55,760
control - get out of the head cage

2150
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:59,280
in one of crowley's writings it's

2151
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:03,199
book 23 or paragraph 23, you know

2152
01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:04,960
when it's like book, it's like

2153
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:08,560
really chapter 23, let's say, okay

2154
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:11,360
and the title of it is "kefale

2155
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:14,880
k-g" or kappa-gamma, so, in greek here

2156
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:17,440
written under the heading

2157
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:20,960
"kefale" means "head" in greek

2158
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:22,000
kappa

2159
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,360
epsilon

2160
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:24,320
fi

2161
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:27,199
alpha, lambda, eta

2162
01:21:27,199 --> 01:21:29,199
are the greek characters

2163
01:21:29,199 --> 01:21:30,159
okay

2164
01:21:30,159 --> 01:21:34,960
so, you pronounce that "kefale" in greek

2165
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:36,719
and that means "head"

2166
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:39,360
and then he writes in english

2167
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:42,080
in like a transliteration there is no

2168
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:44,800
greek word kappa-gamma, right, it's not a

2169
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:47,120
greek word - they're just 2 greek

2170
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:48,159
letters

2171
01:21:48,159 --> 01:21:49,679
back to back

2172
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:50,320
k

2173
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:51,440
g

2174
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:54,719
so, this is like an english

2175
01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:56,880
green language cipher, right, so, this is

2176
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:59,120
how he did things, right

2177
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:01,520
"kefale" - you'd have to learn...

2178
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:02,800
what the word means in greek, you'd have

2179
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:05,199
to look that up in a greek dictionary

2180
01:22:05,199 --> 01:22:07,440
it means "head"

2181
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:08,840
so, like

2182
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:12,480
"cephalic" means "related to the head", right

2183
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:13,920
so, that's

2184
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:17,920
"kefale" in greek, right

2185
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,840
and then the english

2186
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:27,199
transliteration of kappa-gamma is "k-g"

2187
01:22:27,199 --> 01:22:30,719
right, "kefale k-g"

2188
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:33,600
how would you pronounce k and g together ?

2189
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,040
cage

2190
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:37,360
right, you would put that together as the

2191
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:39,280
english word "cage"

2192
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:43,600
so, "kefale" means "head", k-g transliterates

2193
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:45,760
symbolically in green language to the

2194
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:47,280
word "cage"

2195
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:50,719
so, "kefale k-g" literally means "the head

2196
01:22:50,719 --> 01:22:52,560
cage"

2197
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:55,199
and this is how crowley wrote - he set up

2198
01:22:55,199 --> 01:22:56,880
these little ciphers

2199
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:59,360
to make you go and explore

2200
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:00,639
then maybe you'll learn a little bit

2201
01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:02,480
more greek and understand where the

2202
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:04,639
etymology of words comes from

2203
01:23:04,639 --> 01:23:06,400
why do english words...

2204
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:08,400
why are english words

2205
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:10,080
structured in a certain way - because they

2206
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:11,760
come from the ancient

2207
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:12,719
latin

2208
01:23:12,719 --> 01:23:16,000
which then form the romance languages

2209
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,480
you know, you have italian and french, and

2210
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:21,840
portuguese and etcetera

2211
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:24,239
you know, and there's a couple others

2212
01:23:24,239 --> 01:23:25,920
and

2213
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:27,760
you know, then english comes out of those

2214
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:30,719
romance languages, largely, and, again, from

2215
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:33,040
greek obviously is one

2216
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:35,600
you know, and

2217
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:37,520
you'll go and look up things, and you'll

2218
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:38,480
learn

2219
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:40,159
you know, and then you'll see

2220
01:23:40,159 --> 01:23:42,719
symbolic associations, and you'll see

2221
01:23:42,719 --> 01:23:44,800
word play associations with just how

2222
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:46,400
words are spoken

2223
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:48,000
you know, and he's putting together a

2224
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,560
little mini cipher for you to figure out

2225
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:52,400
then it becomes a little bit of a

2226
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:54,480
challenge, and then the student gets

2227
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:56,239
engaged and it's like we're playing a

2228
01:23:56,239 --> 01:23:57,280
game

2229
01:23:57,280 --> 01:24:00,960
right, and it inspires one to keep going

2230
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:03,040
what's he going to come up with next ?

2231
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:04,239
what am i going to have to figure out

2232
01:24:04,239 --> 01:24:05,679
next ? what's he going to challenge me

2233
01:24:05,679 --> 01:24:06,719
with next ?

2234
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:08,800
he did things like that

2235
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:11,199
he liked that cat-and-mouse game

2236
01:24:11,199 --> 01:24:12,719
okay

2237
01:24:12,719 --> 01:24:14,320
i personally don't...

2238
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:16,560
i can find it interesting and

2239
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:19,120
enjoyable, and challenging, and i like how

2240
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:20,000
it

2241
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
pushes your mind

2242
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,639
that's not my style in teaching

2243
01:24:24,639 --> 01:24:27,600
i think that there's a role for that

2244
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:30,560
i prefer the more direct approach, where

2245
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:32,080
i'm simply going to treat you like an

2246
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:34,239
adult that is capable of understanding

2247
01:24:34,239 --> 01:24:37,199
and explain it as simply as i can

2248
01:24:37,199 --> 01:24:39,760
as an adult to another adult and trust

2249
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:41,520
that you will get it

2250
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:43,520
you know, i personally don't like

2251
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:45,360
playing games like that, but that's me

2252
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:47,920
that's my personality, i'm not saying i

2253
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:49,679
can't engage in it and understand what

2254
01:24:49,679 --> 01:24:53,520
he was trying to do - and i do

2255
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:56,560
so, let's look at

2256
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:57,679
what...

2257
01:24:57,679 --> 01:25:01,199
some of the conceptual ideas of

2258
01:25:01,199 --> 01:25:04,800
the term "out" or "getting out" in the

2259
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:07,600
thelemic tradition is, and, again

2260
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:09,920
realize, this ultimately means break down

2261
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:11,600
your mental conditioning and get out of

2262
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:13,760
the mind control spell, that the real

2263
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:16,080
dark occult sorcerers have put you under

2264
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:18,239
and hold you in

2265
01:25:18,239 --> 01:25:19,920
the "o", of course, is the egg - we just

2266
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:21,520
talked about that

2267
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:23,199
you know, the archetype of the

2268
01:25:23,199 --> 01:25:24,880
feminine essence, the egg, the feminine

2269
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:27,280
creativity, the womb of creation

2270
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:29,280
so, that's what the first part is, that's

2271
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:30,880
where it has to begin

2272
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:33,600
it has to begin with the desire to bear

2273
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:36,000
something new, the potentiality of the

2274
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,920
zero, the nothing

2275
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:40,159
right, the cosmic egg is pure

2276
01:25:40,159 --> 01:25:43,360
potentiality, no-thing, no-physicality

2277
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:45,679
it's the void, the cosmic womb of

2278
01:25:45,679 --> 01:25:46,800
creation

2279
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:49,520
yin energy, shakti energy, as they call it

2280
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:52,639
in the Indus Valley traditions

2281
01:25:52,639 --> 01:25:54,480
this represented the egyptian goddess

2282
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:57,280
isis or nuit, as well

2283
01:25:57,280 --> 01:26:00,080
n-u-i-t - "nut"

2284
01:26:00,159 --> 01:26:01,280
nuit

2285
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:03,760
different pronunciations of it, but

2286
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:06,239
it represents that pure feminine

2287
01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:13,679
potentiality, the feminine essence the no-thing from which the everything springs

2288
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:16,159
truth itself

2289
01:26:16,159 --> 01:26:17,840
the universe itself

2290
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:20,480
again, the universe card in the

2291
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:22,159
traditional

2292
01:26:22,159 --> 01:26:23,600
Waite deck

2293
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:26,159
has the world card, has the cosmic

2294
01:26:26,159 --> 01:26:27,120
egg

2295
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:29,040
okay, that oval

2296
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:31,280
and then the goddess inside of it

2297
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:32,159
you know

2298
01:26:32,159 --> 01:26:34,000
beautiful symbology

2299
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,400
and it's widely known, this is the number

2300
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:38,560
zero, this is the cosmic egg, the feminine

2301
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:40,639
essence, the womb of creation, the realm

2302
01:26:40,639 --> 01:26:43,679
of pure spirit, pure potentiality, the

2303
01:26:43,679 --> 01:26:45,679
truth itself

2304
01:26:45,679 --> 01:26:49,679
and the night sky itself

2305
01:26:49,679 --> 01:26:51,040
the universal

2306
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:54,800
drapery of the night sky

2307
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:57,440
and, again, that was nuit, that was isis

2308
01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:01,040
in the egyptian tradition, as well

2309
01:27:02,239 --> 01:27:04,800
beautiful symbology

2310
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:07,440
the "u" - that's that magnetic force, right

2311
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:10,400
the "u" looks like a large hand magnet

2312
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:11,360
right

2313
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:13,760
and, of course, "u" represents "you"

2314
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:15,280
it's "the self"

2315
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:17,600
it's "the higher self", it's not the lower

2316
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:18,480
case

2317
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:20,560
"s"-selfish self

2318
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:22,880
you know, it's connection to the higher

2319
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:26,320
self, the true soul, the true spirit

2320
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:28,880
"u" represents union, the first...

2321
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:31,040
the first letter in

2322
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:33,199
the word "union"

2323
01:27:33,199 --> 01:27:35,120
the "u" represented

2324
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:38,000
again, that sacred bond of the feminine

2325
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,639
and masculine energy, the two

2326
01:27:40,639 --> 01:27:42,639
polar points of that magnetic force

2327
01:27:42,639 --> 01:27:45,040
coming together and creating attraction

2328
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:48,239
creating that alchemical bonding

2329
01:27:48,239 --> 01:27:51,120
it was the true will being realized and

2330
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:53,760
put into effect

2331
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:55,760
because it's related with the self, it's

2332
01:27:55,760 --> 01:28:01,520
the dynamic of self-respect, self-discipline and ultimately self-mastery

2333
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:04,400
all the symbolism of the

2334
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:06,560
letter "u"

2335
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:08,880
in simple english

2336
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:12,239
gematria, simple english symbolism

2337
01:28:12,239 --> 01:28:14,560
and, again, then the "t" - that was... the "t"

2338
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:16,000
is the is the sacred hammer in

2339
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:19,199
freemasonry, the sacred axe or hammer

2340
01:28:19,199 --> 01:28:21,199
thor's hammer, or the sacred axe, the

2341
01:28:21,199 --> 01:28:24,239
dual-headed axe of freemasonry - huge

2342
01:28:24,239 --> 01:28:26,239
symbols in ancient...

2343
01:28:26,239 --> 01:28:27,280
ancient

2344
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:28,480
shamanism

2345
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:30,239
{is that} some of the oldest symbolism

2346
01:28:30,239 --> 01:28:32,719
that exists, and that's why freemasonry

2347
01:28:32,719 --> 01:28:34,960
barred it into its tradition, which, of

2348
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:36,880
course, stems out of the ancient world and

2349
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:38,960
ancient egypt - anybody telling you it's

2350
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:40,800
only a modern tradition, once again, is

2351
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:43,679
either ignorant or lying

2352
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:45,840
so, again, this is power

2353
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:47,040
this is

2354
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:48,800
force, this is will

2355
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:51,280
the will to move forward, right, so, it has

2356
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:52,800
to be born

2357
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,880
out of the heart

2358
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:57,760
right, and then it has to resonate with

2359
01:28:57,760 --> 01:28:59,920
the self, with the higher self, you have

2360
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:02,400
to make that connection to it to receive

2361
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:04,960
that sacred feminine energy, it prepares

2362
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:08,080
the way, it quiets the mind, it empties

2363
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:11,199
oneself, and makes you a vessel of pure

2364
01:29:11,199 --> 01:29:13,520
potentiality, so, that then you could come

2365
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:15,440
into that sacred union with the

2366
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:18,239
sacred masculine essence of the hammer

2367
01:29:18,239 --> 01:29:20,480
the axe, thor's hammer, the sacred

2368
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:23,760
dual-headed axe of freemasonry

2369
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:26,159
masculine power - what is this ?

2370
01:29:26,159 --> 01:29:28,800
action, this is courage

2371
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:31,520
this is the will to act, this is stepping

2372
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:33,600
into the path of the true will

2373
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:35,600
so, it starts with the feminine, it

2374
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:37,120
proceeds through

2375
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:39,679
that neutral point which is about the

2376
01:29:39,679 --> 01:29:42,000
self, the higher connection to the self

2377
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
and then it expresses through courage

2378
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,480
and power in the real world, the will in

2379
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:48,560
the real world

2380
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:50,880
it's desire to know, but for the

2381
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:53,280
reason that you're gonna act in wisdom

2382
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:55,840
with what you know and understand

2383
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:59,760
okay, so, this is the self in the world

2384
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:02,239
right, being in the world, but not of it

2385
01:30:02,239 --> 01:30:04,560
but acting within the world

2386
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:07,520
the individual monad of consciousness

2387
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:10,320
acting in a place of right power with

2388
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:12,960
the hammer, the axe, again, many different

2389
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:14,800
traditions - and norse tradition had this

2390
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:17,120
concept of the sacred hammer, or axe, that

2391
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:18,480
was mjolnir

2392
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:22,639
thor's hammer, which i often wear

2393
01:30:22,639 --> 01:30:24,400
you know, i have silver one, i wear

2394
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:26,400
this black one recently

2395
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:29,040
which represents the war aspect, because

2396
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:30,880
we're at war

2397
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:32,000
you know...

2398
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:35,600
you know, in times of being equal

2399
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:38,719
different colors could represent

2400
01:30:38,719 --> 01:30:41,120
that equality and that equal footing, the

2401
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:42,960
black mjolnir

2402
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:45,520
to me and many others represents a time

2403
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:47,679
of war

2404
01:30:47,679 --> 01:30:49,760
and, you know, this is all the male

2405
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:50,960
energy

2406
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:54,080
yang energy in the eastern traditions

2407
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:55,440
shiva

2408
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:58,080
you know... actual putting forward

2409
01:30:58,080 --> 01:31:01,040
into the will of one's knowledge and

2410
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:04,560
internal aspects

2411
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:06,400
and getting it done

2412
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:08,560
that's the shiva energy of the indus

2413
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:10,400
valley tradition - this would {have been}

2414
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:12,960
horus, the crowned and conquering child

2415
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:16,000
in thelema, in the egyptian or kemetian

2416
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,639
tradition - this was the sacred child, the

2417
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:20,960
sacred male child of the trinity

2418
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:24,719
of isis-osiris-horus, so, if you looked at

2419
01:31:24,719 --> 01:31:27,520
this in the combination, you know, you

2420
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:29,040
could see

2421
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:31,120
the "u" would then be the osiris

2422
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:33,840
energy, the "o" is the isis energy, the "t" is

2423
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:36,239
clearly the horus energy, and then the "u"

2424
01:31:36,239 --> 01:31:38,400
would be the osiris energy

2425
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:40,400
the blending or the union between those

2426
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:42,560
two

2427
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:44,719
and then, of course, this is phallic male

2428
01:31:44,719 --> 01:31:45,679
energy

2429
01:31:45,679 --> 01:31:48,400
all the male energy dynamics are part of

2430
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:49,679
this

2431
01:31:49,679 --> 01:31:51,679
the tau cross - is what it was referred to

2432
01:31:51,679 --> 01:31:52,960
in the ancient

2433
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:54,880
eastern traditions

2434
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:57,520
and greek tradition

2435
01:31:57,520 --> 01:32:00,000
of course, this is, again, courage

2436
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,440
the male energy

2437
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:04,320
the force that has to guide your actual

2438
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:05,920
behavior and will

2439
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:07,600
that you have to conquer

2440
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:08,639
your

2441
01:32:08,639 --> 01:32:10,639
laziness, you have to conquer your apathy

2442
01:32:10,639 --> 01:32:13,120
you have to conquer your fear

2443
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:14,960
not to the extent where you obliterate

2444
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:17,280
it, it's still there, but you're acting in

2445
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:19,920
spite of it, in spite of it being present

2446
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:21,199
you are still doing the right thing

2447
01:32:21,199 --> 01:32:24,480
that's what real courage is

2448
01:32:24,719 --> 01:32:26,400
and when you do that, when you put all

2449
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:28,639
these dynamics together then you finally

2450
01:32:28,639 --> 01:32:30,719
have "out"

2451
01:32:30,719 --> 01:32:32,880
when you have "out" then you are able to

2452
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:34,719
get out, when you have all of these

2453
01:32:34,719 --> 01:32:37,840
dynamics working in non-contradiction

2454
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:39,920
right, look at what we've put here just

2455
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:41,280
on one slide

2456
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:44,000
if you understand all of those dynamics

2457
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:47,040
that's all part of us each as

2458
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:49,520
individuals, each and every one of us

2459
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:51,760
however, how many of us are in total

2460
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:53,440
contradiction

2461
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:56,000
we're not in unity consciousness when it

2462
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,520
comes to this, and this is what thelema

2463
01:32:57,520 --> 01:33:00,000
is all about - one of my probably the very

2464
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,679
next slide is gonna

2465
01:33:01,679 --> 01:33:03,600
totally emphasize that

2466
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:06,080
if we're not in that oneness, the true

2467
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:08,719
oneness, the true law of one, unity within

2468
01:33:08,719 --> 01:33:09,920
the self

2469
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:10,960
see

2470
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:12,880
yes, keep in mind the law of one is about

2471
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:14,960
unity of all of us, ultimately coming

2472
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:15,840
together

2473
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:18,400
and being on the same page as a family

2474
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:20,000
of humanity

2475
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,080
is that the law of one ? - yes, absolutely it

2476
01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:23,920
is, but, you know, what the real law of one

2477
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:26,320
is ? - first and foremost before that, before

2478
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:28,239
you get to that level, you have to be

2479
01:33:28,239 --> 01:33:31,280
unified within the self

2480
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:32,560
and that is what we're talking about

2481
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:34,880
here on this slide

2482
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:37,280
be unified internally first

2483
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:39,840
most people are not, most people will lie

2484
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:41,840
to themselves about them being unified

2485
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:43,840
internally, but they, unfortunately, are

2486
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:44,800
not

2487
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:46,719
and that's the problem, folks, we're

2488
01:33:46,719 --> 01:33:49,440
operating in internal contradiction, and

2489
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:50,639
that's why

2490
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:52,719
the mighty forces of the universe are

2491
01:33:52,719 --> 01:33:55,120
not truly coming to our aid as a species

2492
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:57,920
we're in too much internal contradiction

2493
01:33:57,920 --> 01:33:59,520
let me tell you something, folks, the dark

2494
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:01,280
occultists are not in internal

2495
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:03,520
contradiction, they are very much

2496
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:04,639
operating

2497
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:07,360
on one accord

2498
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:09,280
like one body

2499
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:11,920
you know, the old christian song about

2500
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:14,400
the union with christ, right, the christ

2501
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:17,840
energy, the christos, one bread, one body

2502
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:20,000
they sing this in the catholic tradition

2503
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,320
it's a big song that they sing, what does

2504
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:23,440
it mean ?

2505
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:25,040
it means

2506
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:26,639
we're all separate

2507
01:34:26,639 --> 01:34:28,560
right, but we're coming together over

2508
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:29,760
this thing and then we're going to

2509
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:33,520
operate as one entity, one body

2510
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:35,440
right, that's what the dark occultists

2511
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:38,239
have, unfortunately, they operate as if

2512
01:34:38,239 --> 01:34:40,080
it's one - they're one mind

2513
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:41,920
we, on the other hand, are all over the

2514
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:44,400
place, none of us are on the same page

2515
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:47,280
because we're not uniting over core

2516
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:51,280
principles and real core values, like

2517
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:53,840
objective morality, like natural law, true

2518
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:55,440
principles

2519
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:57,199
this is what we have to get on the same

2520
01:34:57,199 --> 01:34:59,440
page about, when we do that then we'll

2521
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:00,560
get out

2522
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:02,960
we'll get out of the thrall, of the head

2523
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:05,679
cage, of the hypnosis, of the mind control

2524
01:35:05,679 --> 01:35:08,000
and we'll do the "23 skidoo"

2525
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,159
and get out of the head cage, that's

2526
01:35:10,159 --> 01:35:12,000
ultimately what we need

2527
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:15,280
and, you know, this is symbology of his

2528
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:16,480
time

2529
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:18,239
wording of his time

2530
01:35:18,239 --> 01:35:20,400
the way he wanted to play his green

2531
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:22,960
language games with people

2532
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:25,520
crowley was a unique character, he was an

2533
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:27,360
enigma

2534
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:29,040
and this is how he did things, again

2535
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:30,560
behind there i don't talk about it

2536
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:32,239
much, i'm not going to get into every

2537
01:35:32,239 --> 01:35:34,239
single solitary

2538
01:35:34,239 --> 01:35:36,159
aspect of it, this is to whet the

2539
01:35:36,159 --> 01:35:38,400
appetite of the student, folks, we could

2540
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:40,080
do 50

2541
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:42,080
classes on thelema, we could do 50

2542
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:44,400
shows on it, okay

2543
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:46,159
maybe... this will extend into a third

2544
01:35:46,159 --> 01:35:47,840
show, because i have a lot more that i do

2545
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:50,000
want to cover, i want to read from some

2546
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,080
thelemic text, as well

2547
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:55,119
so, maybe i extend this into a third show

2548
01:35:55,119 --> 01:35:57,520
and we do a whole call-in show, because

2549
01:35:57,520 --> 01:35:59,679
there's lots more to talk about, for

2550
01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:01,760
example, the symbol that i chose to put

2551
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:04,320
behind the head cage

2552
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:07,280
concepts - this was crowley's own

2553
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:10,080
fraternal brotherhood, his own secret

2554
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:13,199
society, if you will - was called the a-a

2555
01:36:13,199 --> 01:36:16,320
the argentum astrum

2556
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:20,000
or argentum astrum in latin, that means

2557
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,239
"the silver star"

2558
01:36:22,239 --> 01:36:25,440
so, it says here

2559
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:27,280
sigillum

2560
01:36:28,159 --> 01:36:29,280
sanct...

2561
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:31,679
let's see, give me a moment

2562
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:34,000
let me take the image

2563
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:37,360
sorry, i'm gonna go back for a minute

2564
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:39,360
...just put this on its own slide for a

2565
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:42,639
second, so, i could read it better

2566
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:47,679
yeah, sigillum sanctum

2567
01:36:47,679 --> 01:36:49,840
fraterntatis

2568
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:51,520
a-a

2569
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:53,199
so, that means

2570
01:36:53,199 --> 01:36:55,119
the signum

2571
01:36:55,119 --> 01:36:57,520
of the

2572
01:36:57,520 --> 01:37:00,159
sacred brotherhood

2573
01:37:00,159 --> 01:37:02,560
of the silver star

2574
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:05,366
a-a stood for "argentum astrum", so

2575
01:37:05,391 --> 01:37:11,575
sigillum sanctum fraterntatis argentum astrum

2576
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:13,199
the

2577
01:37:13,199 --> 01:37:15,440
seal or sigil

2578
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:18,239
of the holy brotherhood of the silver

2579
01:37:18,239 --> 01:37:21,119
star - that is the latin inscription going

2580
01:37:21,119 --> 01:37:22,320
around it

2581
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:24,719
then he had the cross in the circle at

2582
01:37:24,719 --> 01:37:25,920
the top

2583
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:27,600
representing the 4

2584
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:28,880
corners

2585
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:32,080
of, again, the seasons, the 4 archangels

2586
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:33,520
etcetera

2587
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:35,199
and then "babalon", and then you see the

2588
01:37:35,199 --> 01:37:38,239
numbers 77, but then united with the

2589
01:37:38,239 --> 01:37:40,719
third 7 as the base or the

2590
01:37:40,719 --> 01:37:43,280
foundation - this represented "love under

2591
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:44,080
will"

2592
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:46,239
the will without that unity of the

2593
01:37:46,239 --> 01:37:47,520
third 7

2594
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:49,199
would not be in harmony with the true

2595
01:37:49,199 --> 01:37:51,280
will, but with the third 7 it would

2596
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:54,480
forming that sacred feminine egg

2597
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:56,000
and then the...

2598
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:59,520
the god in the pantheon of his

2599
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:01,679
pantheon of gods that he created in

2600
01:38:01,679 --> 01:38:03,920
thelema was babalon

2601
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:06,320
which was, again

2602
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:08,960
one of the archangelic consciousnesses

2603
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:09,920
that was

2604
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:12,000
basically working to bring about the age

2605
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,560
of horus and the true will, and, again

2606
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:16,480
it's not babylon

2607
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:17,440
it's

2608
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:19,440
something separate than that

2609
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:21,760
you know, energy of, you know, the

2610
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:23,679
region of the world that we call babylon

2611
01:38:23,679 --> 01:38:26,960
where a lot of dark occultist and dark

2612
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:30,560
occult traditions emerged from, because

2613
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:31,440
you know

2614
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:34,800
obviously, an entire other story, but

2615
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:37,360
emerged from

2616
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:40,800
that area in the middle east where

2617
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:43,360
again, my research

2618
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:44,719
connects

2619
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:49,280
non-human intelligences having

2620
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:51,520
visited and gathered there, and formed

2621
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:54,639
many cities there, and really

2622
01:38:54,639 --> 01:38:56,480
created the religious traditions and the

2623
01:38:56,480 --> 01:38:58,880
occult traditions, the systems of money

2624
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:00,480
that we have, the systems of government

2625
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:02,800
that we have - all created from that area

2626
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:04,400
of the world, and that is why

2627
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:06,639
many people simply refer to the entire

2628
01:39:06,639 --> 01:39:08,560
system, that we are under, as the babylon

2629
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:10,719
system - that is not what we are talking

2630
01:39:10,719 --> 01:39:14,320
about here, crowley invented a system

2631
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:16,159
a pantheon of

2632
01:39:16,159 --> 01:39:18,480
gods in his system

2633
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:21,360
babalon was one that was a positive

2634
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:22,560
energy

2635
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:26,080
and moving people toward the

2636
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:29,040
force of will and the true will

2637
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:30,800
then there were other ones that were

2638
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:33,199
chaotic and worked against that, he

2639
01:39:33,199 --> 01:39:35,600
talked about Choronzon, which i didn't

2640
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:37,679
really plan on getting much into, but to

2641
01:39:37,679 --> 01:39:41,040
contrast it with babalon choronzon was

2642
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:44,480
chaos, it was the force of

2643
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:47,119
involution

2644
01:39:47,119 --> 01:39:49,920
it was not the force of centropy

2645
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:52,000
that works to bring us into alignment

2646
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:52,840
with

2647
01:39:52,840 --> 01:39:55,600
evolutionary will, but it was the

2648
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:57,520
force of entropy that wants to hold us

2649
01:39:57,520 --> 01:40:00,159
back and create chaos, and hardship in

2650
01:40:00,159 --> 01:40:01,600
our lives

2651
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:03,840
the grindstone that we must work against

2652
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:06,480
if you will - choronzon

2653
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:07,600
and

2654
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:08,960
you know, that's the force that we have

2655
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:11,840
to constantly be fighting against

2656
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:14,480
so, just wanted to quickly show people

2657
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:16,080
some of the symbolism

2658
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:18,320
of the order of the

2659
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:21,440
silver star, crowley's own magickal

2660
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:22,639
society

2661
01:40:22,639 --> 01:40:27,360
and, again, the septenery, the 7-pointed star

2662
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:30,960
again, 7s all over the symbolism

2663
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:33,600
that's, you know, again, my

2664
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:35,040
occultic

2665
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:37,600
symbolic interpretation of that

2666
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:40,639
let's jump back into

2667
01:40:40,639 --> 01:40:42,880
moving on from we were talking about

2668
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:44,000
getting out

2669
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,159
i think, i covered everything i wanted to

2670
01:40:46,159 --> 01:40:48,400
cover as part of that concept

2671
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:50,960
and, you know, explain why i put that

2672
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:52,880
symbolism behind there, which was

2673
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:56,000
crowley's sigil of the silver star

2674
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,400
so, let's move on to the concept that

2675
01:40:58,400 --> 01:41:01,600
"love is the law", again, we sort of opened

2676
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:03,119
up this entire

2677
01:41:05,360 --> 01:41:06,800
you know

2678
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:08,960
expose of

2679
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:11,679
thelemic philosophy with the concept

2680
01:41:11,679 --> 01:41:15,600
of the true will, and that

2681
01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:19,119
"do what thou wilt shall be the whole of

2682
01:41:19,119 --> 01:41:20,320
the law"

2683
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:22,239
but then people leave off the second

2684
01:41:22,239 --> 01:41:23,360
half

2685
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:27,520
"love is the law", "love IS the law", right

2686
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:29,600
emphasize the "is" here

2687
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:30,800
"love

2688
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:33,600
IS the law

2689
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:36,159
love under will", so, these are going to be

2690
01:41:36,159 --> 01:41:39,520
the next two concepts - what does "love IS

2691
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:42,400
the law" mean, and what does "love under

2692
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:45,800
will" mean

2693
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:46,800
there

2694
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:48,800
it's a little bit more complex than what

2695
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:51,199
most people make it out to be, but once

2696
01:41:51,199 --> 01:41:53,840
it is understood clearly, and you put it

2697
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:55,600
all together, then you'll understand what

2698
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:57,440
crowley was actually referring to by

2699
01:41:57,440 --> 01:41:59,119
making those statements

2700
01:41:59,119 --> 01:42:01,520
you can't separate them

2701
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:04,639
see, when people say "do what thou wilt"

2702
01:42:04,639 --> 01:42:06,159
you're separating it from the most

2703
01:42:06,159 --> 01:42:07,520
important parts

2704
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:09,520
"love IS the law

2705
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:12,000
love under will"

2706
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,320
if you break it from that - it loses its

2707
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:16,880
contextual meaning, and then, yes, it can

2708
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:18,719
become satanism

2709
01:42:18,719 --> 01:42:22,239
it can become dark occultism, you

2710
01:42:22,239 --> 01:42:24,400
never separate those things, you never

2711
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:26,000
break the first part of the statement

2712
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,560
off from the second half "love is the law,

2713
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:30,800
love under will"

2714
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:32,320
so

2715
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:34,159
again, here's some of the symbolism of

2716
01:42:34,159 --> 01:42:36,080
thelema - this was the title card

2717
01:42:36,080 --> 01:42:37,600
actually, the symbolism from the title

2718
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:40,880
card, again, the all-seeing eye

2719
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:42,800
representing the creator's light and the

2720
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:45,520
creator's law coming into our realm, for

2721
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:47,280
us to receive, for us to understand, and

2722
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:48,639
then align our

2723
01:42:48,639 --> 01:42:50,480
behavior to it

2724
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:52,400
the sacred feminine energy of the dove

2725
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:54,960
and then the sacred feminine chalice

2726
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:57,600
of the sacred heart and the flame, giving

2727
01:42:57,600 --> 01:43:00,320
birth to the sacred child

2728
01:43:00,320 --> 01:43:02,719
of right action

2729
01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:05,280
being born of one's thoughts and one's

2730
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:07,920
emotions, and then the sacred child

2731
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:09,920
coming from the womb of creation, the

2732
01:43:09,920 --> 01:43:12,639
sacred chalice, the holy grail, the sacred

2733
01:43:12,639 --> 01:43:15,440
cup, the christos's cup

2734
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:17,280
the sacred heart

2735
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:20,320
right, and then that drives the energy of

2736
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:21,920
the will

2737
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:22,960
okay

2738
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:25,600
so

2739
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:27,840
this is the progression

2740
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:29,920
truth-love-freedom

2741
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:31,920
it's right there, it's right there in the

2742
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:33,119
symbolism

2743
01:43:33,119 --> 01:43:34,159
truth

2744
01:43:34,159 --> 01:43:38,239
is that essence of the creator

2745
01:43:38,239 --> 01:43:41,360
you know, the higher level will, making

2746
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:43,920
its law known

2747
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:45,440
but it's for us

2748
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:47,119
to listen

2749
01:43:47,119 --> 01:43:49,119
with a mind that is prepared to receive

2750
01:43:49,119 --> 01:43:50,800
that truth

2751
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:52,880
and we have to make way for that with

2752
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:54,560
the feminine energy, that's the dove, the

2753
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:57,119
holy spirit, so, it's like god the father

2754
01:43:57,119 --> 01:43:59,440
is at the top, the holy spirit, the dove

2755
01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:02,239
in the middle, and then god the son, but,

2756
01:44:02,239 --> 01:44:04,800
again, these even christian correlations

2757
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:07,280
and concepts are allegorical, it's

2758
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:10,719
thought-emotion-action

2759
01:44:10,719 --> 01:44:14,000
right, it's at the bottom body

2760
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,719
mind at the top, spirit in the middle, the

2761
01:44:16,719 --> 01:44:17,840
unifier

2762
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:18,719
okay

2763
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:19,760
it's

2764
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:22,480
father-mother-child

2765
01:44:22,480 --> 01:44:25,119
sacred feminine-masculine-child because

2766
01:44:25,119 --> 01:44:28,239
it's representative of right action

2767
01:44:28,239 --> 01:44:30,719
okay, the mother is the dove, the sacred

2768
01:44:30,719 --> 01:44:33,199
feminine, spirit

2769
01:44:33,199 --> 01:44:35,920
the bringer of peace

2770
01:44:35,920 --> 01:44:37,760
because it's the heart

2771
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:41,119
you know, and then that energy is then

2772
01:44:41,119 --> 01:44:43,520
infused and gives birth to

2773
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:45,119
right action

2774
01:44:45,119 --> 01:44:46,800
action born of the heart based

2775
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:48,400
intelligence and the flame

2776
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:49,440
of

2777
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:51,119
right action

2778
01:44:51,119 --> 01:44:52,239
you know

2779
01:44:52,239 --> 01:44:53,440
the will

2780
01:44:53,440 --> 01:44:57,040
always represented by fire, flame etcetera

2781
01:44:57,040 --> 01:45:00,320
coming from the womb, the chalice, the

2782
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:04,239
sacred feminine womb, the holy grail

2783
01:45:04,239 --> 01:45:06,560
you know, this is the trinity

2784
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:08,880
crowley knew all this symbolism, thelemites

2785
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:12,560
know the symbolism if they study it

2786
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:14,800
it's nothing new

2787
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:16,400
same symbolism we've been talking about

2788
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:20,719
since day one, it's consciousness - thought-emotion-action unified as one in the

2789
01:45:20,719 --> 01:45:23,520
sacred feminine womb, all within the womb

2790
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:25,920
that external womb shape that's

2791
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:28,320
nuit itself, that's nuit

2792
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:31,199
right, that is

2793
01:45:31,199 --> 01:45:33,600
the cosmic egg, once again, we talked

2794
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:35,840
about that over and over already

2795
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:38,320
the archetypal symbolism of creation, the

2796
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:40,800
womb, the egg of creation

2797
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:42,400
all within

2798
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:43,920
that

2799
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:48,760
universal force of potentiality

2800
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:51,600
so, just as i... my wording here on the

2801
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:54,159
slide just as natural law itself is

2802
01:45:54,159 --> 01:45:56,159
ultimately an expression of creation's

2803
01:45:56,159 --> 01:45:57,199
love

2804
01:45:57,199 --> 01:45:59,520
this is all about love being the law of

2805
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:02,159
creation, right, again, natural law is not

2806
01:46:02,159 --> 01:46:04,639
a set of constraints to create slavery

2807
01:46:04,639 --> 01:46:07,119
this is how the dark occultists see it

2808
01:46:07,119 --> 01:46:08,639
it is not that

2809
01:46:08,639 --> 01:46:11,280
it is an expression of creation's love

2810
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:14,080
for everything within creation, because

2811
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:17,360
it is a dynamic that operates such that

2812
01:46:17,360 --> 01:46:20,400
it puts us on our maximum and most

2813
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:23,119
efficient path for evolutionary progress

2814
01:46:23,119 --> 01:46:25,520
within creation, and there could be no

2815
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:29,280
better expression of love than that

2816
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:31,360
of course, that's what the universe wants

2817
01:46:31,360 --> 01:46:33,280
for us, that's what the creator itself

2818
01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:35,280
wants for us, this intelligent

2819
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:36,960
organizing force

2820
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:39,840
once that maximum path of evolutionary

2821
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:42,000
learning development and growth for its

2822
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,239
creation

2823
01:46:44,239 --> 01:46:46,719
so, just as natural law itself is that

2824
01:46:46,719 --> 01:46:48,639
force, it is that expression of

2825
01:46:48,639 --> 01:46:50,159
creation's love

2826
01:46:50,159 --> 01:46:53,679
the alignment of one's own personal will

2827
01:46:53,679 --> 01:46:56,400
to creations will

2828
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:59,280
to align with and serve natural

2829
01:46:59,280 --> 01:47:01,360
law, and i have to

2830
01:47:01,360 --> 01:47:02,719
fix that

2831
01:47:02,719 --> 01:47:06,119
give me a moment

2832
01:47:08,239 --> 01:47:10,400
let's see, the alignment of one's

2833
01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:13,119
personal will to creation's will is to

2834
01:47:13,119 --> 01:47:17,119
align with and serve natural law -

2835
01:47:19,119 --> 01:47:24,320
to align with and serve natural law is

2836
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:27,040
an act of love born out of higher

2837
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:30,000
consciousness - i apologize for the errors

2838
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:31,199
i

2839
01:47:31,199 --> 01:47:33,119
clearly should have taken more time to

2840
01:47:33,119 --> 01:47:35,360
proofread some of these slides, i'll make

2841
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:38,320
sure that they are definitely correct

2842
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:41,040
when they go to the

2843
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:43,280
podcast section this week

2844
01:47:43,280 --> 01:47:45,440
let's jump back into this

2845
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:47,280
so, let's see how this re-reads again

2846
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:50,320
just as natural law itself is ultimately

2847
01:47:50,320 --> 01:47:52,560
an expression of creation's love

2848
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:55,440
the alignment of one's personal will to

2849
01:47:55,440 --> 01:47:58,560
creation's will

2850
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:02,000
to align with and serve natural law

2851
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,800
is an act of love born out of higher

2852
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:06,239
consciousness

2853
01:48:06,239 --> 01:48:09,360
this form of universal love is actually

2854
01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:12,480
the very foundational basis of law in

2855
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:13,840
the cosmos

2856
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:16,400
again, because it's

2857
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:19,520
our alignment of our personal will

2858
01:48:19,520 --> 01:48:23,040
to creation's will is simply a mirror

2859
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:24,239
image

2860
01:48:24,239 --> 01:48:25,199
of

2861
01:48:25,199 --> 01:48:28,560
the creator putting the higher law of

2862
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:31,040
natural law into effect in the universe

2863
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:33,440
to guide and direct our evolutionary

2864
01:48:33,440 --> 01:48:35,440
progress, so, we can learn

2865
01:48:35,440 --> 01:48:38,000
from our mistakes, so, we can learn and

2866
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,159
grow in consciousness of what to do and

2867
01:48:40,159 --> 01:48:42,400
what not to do

2868
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:44,560
so, it may be a little bit of a run-on

2869
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:46,400
sentence there, but i think now it makes

2870
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:47,520
more sense

2871
01:48:47,520 --> 01:48:49,679
and hopefully it will convey the concept

2872
01:48:49,679 --> 01:48:51,520
that that is what it means, that love is

2873
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:53,360
the law

2874
01:48:53,360 --> 01:48:55,360
creation's law

2875
01:48:55,360 --> 01:48:57,840
called natural law

2876
01:48:57,840 --> 01:48:59,920
being in effect is actually an

2877
01:48:59,920 --> 01:49:02,880
expression of love

2878
01:49:03,199 --> 01:49:06,639
and then our alignment to that higher

2879
01:49:06,639 --> 01:49:11,199
law is also our personal act of love

2880
01:49:11,199 --> 01:49:13,520
to put our will into alignment with

2881
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:15,599
natural will, to

2882
01:49:15,599 --> 01:49:18,400
align with natural law and serve natural

2883
01:49:18,400 --> 01:49:19,199
law

2884
01:49:19,199 --> 01:49:21,360
and then ultimately teach it to others

2885
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:22,719
so, that we can

2886
01:49:22,719 --> 01:49:25,119
hand this understanding down to future

2887
01:49:25,119 --> 01:49:27,760
generations of people

2888
01:49:27,760 --> 01:49:29,679
that's an act of universal love, that is

2889
01:49:29,679 --> 01:49:32,159
Agape itself

2890
01:49:32,159 --> 01:49:35,520
is not natural law Agape itself ?

2891
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:37,679
is that not the creator's ultimate

2892
01:49:37,679 --> 01:49:40,880
expression of love for the creation ?

2893
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:43,360
and it is

2894
01:49:43,360 --> 01:49:45,119
this is what it means that "love is the

2895
01:49:45,119 --> 01:49:47,119
law"

2896
01:49:47,119 --> 01:49:49,679
this symbol in thelema represents Agape

2897
01:49:49,679 --> 01:49:52,159
love, true love, as we talked about last

2898
01:49:52,159 --> 01:49:53,040
week

2899
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:56,000
and that is what natural law is - "love is

2900
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:57,520
the law"

2901
01:49:57,520 --> 01:50:00,000
natural law is the creator's love, it's

2902
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,239
Agape, love

2903
01:50:02,239 --> 01:50:06,000
aligning our will with that force is our

2904
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:09,199
act of Agape - universal love, they're one

2905
01:50:09,199 --> 01:50:10,480
and the same

2906
01:50:10,480 --> 01:50:12,800
to align one's

2907
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:15,040
personal will with the will of creation

2908
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:17,760
is to serve natural laws, to align with

2909
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:20,080
and serve natural law, they're one and the

2910
01:50:20,080 --> 01:50:20,880
same

2911
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:24,639
so, Agape is natural law

2912
01:50:24,639 --> 01:50:26,080
thelema

2913
01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:28,239
is natural law

2914
01:50:28,239 --> 01:50:29,679
kabbalah

2915
01:50:29,679 --> 01:50:32,960
is natural law, true freemasonry is

2916
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:34,960
natural law, true rosicrucianism is

2917
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:37,040
natural law, if we get down to the

2918
01:50:37,040 --> 01:50:38,480
essence

2919
01:50:38,480 --> 01:50:40,320
if we strip away

2920
01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:42,719
earthly identification from

2921
01:50:42,719 --> 01:50:44,639
how we interpret the tradition, the

2922
01:50:44,639 --> 01:50:46,960
people in it, the orders, the

2923
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:49,840
brotherhoods, the, you know, all the groups

2924
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:51,599
and individuals

2925
01:50:51,599 --> 01:50:53,119
you got to strip that away, you got to

2926
01:50:53,119 --> 01:50:55,040
get down to the principles, you got to

2927
01:50:55,040 --> 01:50:58,639
get down to the core philosophy

2928
01:50:58,639 --> 01:51:01,040
and then ultimately that is

2929
01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:04,400
the Agape - form of love to serve and help

2930
01:51:04,400 --> 01:51:07,760
natural law to be not only continue its

2931
01:51:07,760 --> 01:51:11,599
expression of love, but to be understood

2932
01:51:11,599 --> 01:51:14,639
and aligned with

2933
01:51:14,880 --> 01:51:16,239
the only way we're ultimately going to

2934
01:51:16,239 --> 01:51:17,840
do that is to teach more people about

2935
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:19,840
how it operates in the world

2936
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:22,000
from a higher perspective, not from some

2937
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
bullshit religious level

2938
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
not even from some

2939
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:29,599
cult-like veneration of crowley and any

2940
01:51:29,599 --> 01:51:31,520
other occultist - who cares about any of

2941
01:51:31,520 --> 01:51:32,560
that ?

2942
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:34,560
we have to teach it from a principal

2943
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:36,880
perspective

2944
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:39,840
from a philosophical perspective

2945
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:43,920
not a religious tradition perspective

2946
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:46,800
so, when we understand that, these are

2947
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:50,320
equivalents - Agape is thelema, is natural

2948
01:51:50,320 --> 01:51:51,199
law

2949
01:51:51,199 --> 01:51:55,119
that's what is meant by "love is the law"

2950
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,560
what is meant by "love under will" ?

2951
01:51:58,560 --> 01:52:01,360
it's quite literal, crowley like to do

2952
01:52:01,360 --> 01:52:03,440
these very literal

2953
01:52:03,440 --> 01:52:04,880
things where

2954
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:06,800
you get used to trying to interpret it

2955
01:52:06,800 --> 01:52:08,320
symbolically and allegorically, and

2956
01:52:08,320 --> 01:52:09,520
through green language, and then

2957
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:10,719
occasionally he'll hit you with

2958
01:52:10,719 --> 01:52:13,440
something that's very quite

2959
01:52:13,440 --> 01:52:15,599
literal to the point where you think "it

2960
01:52:15,599 --> 01:52:18,000
can't be that literal - can it ?"

2961
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:19,679
the word "under"

2962
01:52:19,679 --> 01:52:22,880
literally means "underneath"

2963
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:26,080
"love underneath the will"

2964
01:52:26,080 --> 01:52:29,040
meaning, just think about what that means

2965
01:52:29,040 --> 01:52:31,920
if you place something on top of it and

2966
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:34,320
it's underneath - that thing on the bottom

2967
01:52:34,320 --> 01:52:36,480
acts as the foundation, that's going to

2968
01:52:36,480 --> 01:52:38,480
uphold and support the thing you place

2969
01:52:38,480 --> 01:52:40,239
on top of it

2970
01:52:40,239 --> 01:52:41,119
so,

2971
01:52:41,119 --> 01:52:44,239
if i put my hand on... if i drop this

2972
01:52:44,239 --> 01:52:46,639
bottle right now it's going to fall

2973
01:52:46,639 --> 01:52:48,000
gravity is going to pull it down where

2974
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
it's going to fall, water might spill out

2975
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:54,000
right, but if i place my hand under it

2976
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:57,040
then my hand acts as the support or the

2977
01:52:57,040 --> 01:53:01,440
foundation for this mass to rest upon as

2978
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:03,440
a foundation

2979
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:04,639
literally

2980
01:53:04,639 --> 01:53:07,119
the term "love under will" meant

2981
01:53:07,119 --> 01:53:10,080
"make love the foundation,

2982
01:53:10,080 --> 01:53:13,360
make Agape-love the foundation", forget

2983
01:53:13,360 --> 01:53:15,199
the arrows and

2984
01:53:15,199 --> 01:53:17,679
you know, philos forms of love, i

2985
01:53:17,679 --> 01:53:20,320
mean, they have their place, clearly

2986
01:53:20,320 --> 01:53:21,280
but

2987
01:53:21,280 --> 01:53:23,599
we're talking about Agape-love - acting as

2988
01:53:23,599 --> 01:53:27,280
the foundation for our will

2989
01:53:27,280 --> 01:53:30,880
to then move it forward and serve higher

2990
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:33,760
will, to align with and serve the higher

2991
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:34,639
will

2992
01:53:34,639 --> 01:53:38,480
so, literally put Agape-love

2993
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:40,800
at the bottom as the foundation, meaning

2994
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:43,280
don't build anything on top

2995
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:45,280
unless that's the foundation

2996
01:53:45,280 --> 01:53:46,800
or it's doomed to failure - you're

2997
01:53:46,800 --> 01:53:50,159
building a new tower of babel

2998
01:53:50,159 --> 01:53:51,040
okay

2999
01:53:51,040 --> 01:53:53,119
you're building something that

3000
01:53:53,119 --> 01:53:56,800
has a flawed axiomatic foundation from

3001
01:53:56,800 --> 01:53:58,719
ground level, from

3002
01:53:58,719 --> 01:54:01,040
ground zero

3003
01:54:01,040 --> 01:54:03,280
and that's not going to stand for very

3004
01:54:03,280 --> 01:54:04,880
long

3005
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:06,560
so, the foundation in the plane of

3006
01:54:06,560 --> 01:54:09,360
causality has to be Agape-love, it has to

3007
01:54:09,360 --> 01:54:12,719
be higher love, true love

3008
01:54:12,719 --> 01:54:14,480
universal love

3009
01:54:14,480 --> 01:54:17,440
love for truth, love for justice, love for

3010
01:54:17,440 --> 01:54:19,520
freedom

3011
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:22,639
and that's our foundational

3012
01:54:22,639 --> 01:54:23,679
basis

3013
01:54:23,679 --> 01:54:26,320
upon which we build ever... any structure

3014
01:54:26,320 --> 01:54:28,159
we're going to build on top of that

3015
01:54:28,159 --> 01:54:29,520
that's got to be

3016
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:32,960
on strong foundational footing

3017
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:36,679
in the plane of causality

3018
01:54:36,880 --> 01:54:40,800
then we build the will on top of that

3019
01:54:41,199 --> 01:54:45,760
so, thelema gets built on top of Agape

3020
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:49,119
it is built on the foundation of Agape

3021
01:54:49,119 --> 01:54:51,440
and that then becomes the plane of

3022
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:53,679
effects that manifest the things that

3023
01:54:53,679 --> 01:54:55,119
then we're going to experience in the

3024
01:54:55,119 --> 01:54:56,800
world

3025
01:54:56,800 --> 01:54:59,520
so, if Agape is the plane of causality

3026
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:01,920
that we create within

3027
01:55:01,920 --> 01:55:04,800
and we use that as our building essence

3028
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:06,719
to lay the foundation down for all of

3029
01:55:06,719 --> 01:55:08,320
our actions

3030
01:55:08,320 --> 01:55:10,000
and then we use our will to build our

3031
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:11,840
actual physical world foundations that

3032
01:55:11,840 --> 01:55:13,440
are going to be enter the plane of

3033
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:15,920
effects, the manifestations in the very

3034
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:18,480
real 3-D physical world, if those are

3035
01:55:18,480 --> 01:55:20,800
built on top of Agape

3036
01:55:20,800 --> 01:55:22,880
then we have firm footing, we have the

3037
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:25,280
firm foundation to build the structures

3038
01:55:25,280 --> 01:55:26,880
that we want to build on top of that

3039
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:29,280
they're going to be on solid ground

3040
01:55:29,280 --> 01:55:31,920
if it's not built upon Agape, which is

3041
01:55:31,920 --> 01:55:34,800
higher love, we're on very shaky

3042
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:37,360
foundational ground

3043
01:55:37,360 --> 01:55:38,800
and we're not really building in the

3044
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:41,440
plane of causality then

3045
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:44,639
which is folly, which is madness

3046
01:55:44,639 --> 01:55:45,440
we're not going to get the

3047
01:55:45,440 --> 01:55:47,679
manifestations that we want, this is how

3048
01:55:47,679 --> 01:55:50,719
the real laws of attraction work

3049
01:55:50,719 --> 01:55:53,040
so, now if we write this simply as a an

3050
01:55:53,040 --> 01:55:54,960
equation, right

3051
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:58,560
look at it as a fraction, right

3052
01:55:58,560 --> 01:56:01,760
Agape, the foundation, under the will, and

3053
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:03,760
we have that dividing line

3054
01:56:03,760 --> 01:56:05,599
look at it as simply we're making a

3055
01:56:05,599 --> 01:56:06,800
fraction

3056
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:08,000
okay

3057
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,719
what does this equal ? - well, do gematria

3058
01:56:10,719 --> 01:56:13,599
perform gematria upon thelema and Agape

3059
01:56:13,599 --> 01:56:15,040
and we already know what that is, we

3060
01:56:15,040 --> 01:56:17,119
looked at that last week

3061
01:56:17,119 --> 01:56:19,679
it's 93 - each of these

3062
01:56:19,679 --> 01:56:23,199
represent 93, so, if we write it

3063
01:56:23,199 --> 01:56:24,639
symbolically

3064
01:56:24,639 --> 01:56:26,159
in numbers

3065
01:56:26,159 --> 01:56:28,719
it's 93

3066
01:56:28,719 --> 01:56:33,280
under 93, or 93 above 93

3067
01:56:33,280 --> 01:56:35,040
what does that equal ?

3068
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:37,360
any number over itself written as a

3069
01:56:37,360 --> 01:56:38,800
fraction

3070
01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:40,719
is the number one

3071
01:56:40,719 --> 01:56:43,280
there's that unity consciousness

3072
01:56:43,280 --> 01:56:44,480
you see

3073
01:56:44,480 --> 01:56:46,719
unless you build

3074
01:56:46,719 --> 01:56:48,480
the things that you're performing with

3075
01:56:48,480 --> 01:56:50,800
your will and aligning your personal

3076
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:53,280
will to the higher will of creation, and

3077
01:56:53,280 --> 01:56:55,199
unless you're building it upon that firm

3078
01:56:55,199 --> 01:56:59,599
foundation of higher level love-Agape

3079
01:56:59,599 --> 01:57:03,360
it's not unity, it's not divided, will not

3080
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:06,400
equal 1 - it's not the law of 1

3081
01:57:06,400 --> 01:57:08,880
that's why "love is the law", that is the

3082
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:12,080
law of 1 - "love under will" also is the

3083
01:57:12,080 --> 01:57:13,840
law of 1

3084
01:57:13,840 --> 01:57:16,719
it literally equals 1

3085
01:57:16,719 --> 01:57:17,760
okay

3086
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:21,920
numerologically, in gematria terms

3087
01:57:21,920 --> 01:57:24,320
so, this is that unity, consciousness

3088
01:57:24,320 --> 01:57:27,440
non-duality, non-contradiction, unified in

3089
01:57:27,440 --> 01:57:29,679
thought, emotion and action, enlightened

3090
01:57:29,679 --> 01:57:32,320
consciousness

3091
01:57:33,199 --> 01:57:37,119
beautiful symbology, if it's properly understood

3092
01:57:37,119 --> 01:57:41,440
if it isn't properly understood - forget about it

3093
01:57:43,199 --> 01:57:45,679
then people only see numbers and symbols

3094
01:57:45,679 --> 01:57:46,800
and they don't know what they mean, and

3095
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:48,320
they don't understand the conceptual

3096
01:57:48,320 --> 01:57:49,679
ideas, and they don't understand the

3097
01:57:49,679 --> 01:57:51,440
allegory, and they think it's all a bunch

3098
01:57:51,440 --> 01:57:54,719
of nonsense and rubbish

3099
01:57:54,719 --> 01:57:57,440
but when it's properly decoded

3100
01:57:57,440 --> 01:58:00,480
it presents a rich encoded

3101
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:02,960
tradition of principles

3102
01:58:02,960 --> 01:58:06,960
of concepts, of philosophy

3103
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:10,159
that can help guide one in life

3104
01:58:10,159 --> 01:58:11,599
but that's if

3105
01:58:11,599 --> 01:58:13,679
we quiet our mind enough to truly listen

3106
01:58:13,679 --> 01:58:16,560
to that voice of wisdom and reason

3107
01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:18,320
and understand

3108
01:58:18,320 --> 01:58:20,159
they encoded it like that to challenge

3109
01:58:20,159 --> 01:58:21,920
the mind, they encoded it like that to

3110
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:23,520
keep it secret from people that want to

3111
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:25,840
destroy it

3112
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:28,239
you know, i understand the reasons for

3113
01:58:28,239 --> 01:58:31,199
occulting things - i don't personally

3114
01:58:31,199 --> 01:58:32,880
agree with them in the time we are

3115
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:35,840
living in

3116
01:58:38,480 --> 01:58:41,360
so, let's move on

3117
01:58:41,440 --> 01:58:44,159
let's take a look at one of the seminal

3118
01:58:44,159 --> 01:58:46,560
pieces of writing in thelema

3119
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:47,599
what

3120
01:58:47,599 --> 01:58:51,280
crowley and other thelemites

3121
01:58:51,280 --> 01:58:54,719
called in the occult tradition

3122
01:58:54,719 --> 01:58:56,320
the

3123
01:58:56,320 --> 01:58:58,800
"manifesto of thelema"

3124
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:01,119
this was the thelemic manifesto, you

3125
01:59:01,119 --> 01:59:02,480
could call

3126
01:59:02,480 --> 01:59:05,360
"liber oz"

3127
01:59:05,840 --> 01:59:08,080
and

3128
01:59:09,520 --> 01:59:11,440
you know, you have another different

3129
01:59:11,440 --> 01:59:13,840
incarnation of the 7-pointed star

3130
01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:16,639
you have the crescent moons

3131
01:59:16,639 --> 01:59:17,840
creating

3132
01:59:17,840 --> 01:59:20,080
you know, a trinity

3133
01:59:20,080 --> 01:59:22,560
that is upholding the sun, the symbol of

3134
01:59:22,560 --> 01:59:24,480
the sun which obviously

3135
01:59:24,480 --> 01:59:27,280
is a symbol of, again, the trinity, the

3136
01:59:27,280 --> 01:59:30,239
star could represent osiris, the moons

3137
01:59:30,239 --> 01:59:32,400
could represent isis, and then the sun

3138
01:59:32,400 --> 01:59:34,800
represents horus, the conquering

3139
01:59:34,800 --> 01:59:37,599
child in thelema

3140
01:59:37,599 --> 01:59:41,199
enclosed by the "o", again, the

3141
01:59:41,199 --> 01:59:42,639
feminine womb

3142
01:59:42,639 --> 01:59:45,760
the womb of pure potentiality, creation

3143
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:48,000
itself, the universe itself

3144
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:51,440
the boundary conditions of natural law

3145
01:59:51,440 --> 01:59:53,920
and then, again, you have the

3146
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:56,880
o-z representing the wizard of oz

3147
01:59:56,880 --> 01:59:59,360
this is also a green language symbolism

3148
01:59:59,360 --> 02:00:01,280
to the wizard aiwass

3149
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:04,639
right, the wizard of oz, the wizard aiwass

3150
02:00:04,639 --> 02:00:06,639
right, that's the holy guardian angel

3151
02:00:06,639 --> 02:00:09,520
concept, crowley's holy guardian angel

3152
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:11,840
named aiwass

3153
02:00:11,840 --> 02:00:14,560
you have the beast concept - "666" - there at

3154
02:00:14,560 --> 02:00:17,119
the bottom that has to be ultimately

3155
02:00:17,119 --> 02:00:19,360
conquered by the crowned and conquering

3156
02:00:19,360 --> 02:00:21,760
child horus, represented by the sun, the

3157
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:24,000
dot with the circle around it, which is

3158
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:27,040
again, drawn with the compass

3159
02:00:27,040 --> 02:00:29,360
of freemasonry, the point in the middle

3160
02:00:29,360 --> 02:00:31,360
and then we draw the circle around that

3161
02:00:31,360 --> 02:00:34,000
with the compass, again, the compass is

3162
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,239
symbolic in free-masonry of higher

3163
02:00:36,239 --> 02:00:38,800
consciousness and right action

3164
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:41,040
circumscribing the square, base

3165
02:00:41,040 --> 02:00:43,040
consciousness

3166
02:00:43,040 --> 02:00:44,159
but, also

3167
02:00:44,159 --> 02:00:46,400
informing us that we have to place our

3168
02:00:46,400 --> 02:00:48,400
actions firmly upon the square, upon

3169
02:00:48,400 --> 02:00:50,400
right foundation, that is ruled by the

3170
02:00:50,400 --> 02:00:52,960
compasses, compassion, heart based

3171
02:00:52,960 --> 02:00:55,840
intelligence

3172
02:00:57,119 --> 02:00:59,360
true will

3173
02:00:59,360 --> 02:01:01,599
lots of symbolism right in the symbology

3174
02:01:01,599 --> 02:01:04,320
of the book "liber oz", but the biggest

3175
02:01:04,320 --> 02:01:06,719
symbolism is the word itself

3176
02:01:06,719 --> 02:01:10,320
"oz", when turned on its side

3177
02:01:10,320 --> 02:01:12,400
forms the word "on"

3178
02:01:12,400 --> 02:01:15,679
if we just simply rotate 90 degrees - "on"

3179
02:01:15,679 --> 02:01:17,440
and then if you read that backwards it's

3180
02:01:17,440 --> 02:01:18,560
"no"

3181
02:01:18,560 --> 02:01:20,400
so, you not only have the concept of the

3182
02:01:20,400 --> 02:01:24,159
wizard of oz, which was a

3183
02:01:24,159 --> 02:01:27,679
theosophical allegory written by frank

3184
02:01:27,679 --> 02:01:29,920
baum

3185
02:01:29,920 --> 02:01:33,360
l. frank baum, a theosophist himself, wrote

3186
02:01:33,360 --> 02:01:35,520
the books about the wizard of oz to

3187
02:01:35,520 --> 02:01:36,560
convey

3188
02:01:36,560 --> 02:01:39,840
the occult philosophy of theosophy about

3189
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:42,000
the unification of our thoughts, emotions

3190
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:45,280
and actions, the wizard of oz - i have a

3191
02:01:45,280 --> 02:01:46,880
a breakdown of the wizard of oz

3192
02:01:46,880 --> 02:01:49,040
allegorically i call it

3193
02:01:49,040 --> 02:01:50,639
"everything i learned in life i learned

3194
02:01:50,639 --> 02:01:53,119
by watching the wizard of oz"

3195
02:01:53,119 --> 02:01:54,480
and in that i break down the

3196
02:01:54,480 --> 02:01:57,280
theosophical allegory presented in baum's

3197
02:01:57,280 --> 02:02:00,239
books and the movie based on them

3198
02:02:00,239 --> 02:02:02,000
that is about

3199
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,239
re-discovery of the soul, re-discovery of

3200
02:02:04,239 --> 02:02:06,800
the self, who dorothy represents

3201
02:02:06,800 --> 02:02:09,599
her guardian angel being toto, an animal

3202
02:02:09,599 --> 02:02:13,040
spirit, an animal totem - toto

3203
02:02:13,040 --> 02:02:14,320
and

3204
02:02:14,320 --> 02:02:16,880
she going through the land of oz which

3205
02:02:16,880 --> 02:02:18,800
is ultimately representative of the self

3206
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:21,280
and the soul's journey in the universe

3207
02:02:21,280 --> 02:02:23,440
here on earth

3208
02:02:23,440 --> 02:02:24,560
and

3209
02:02:24,560 --> 02:02:27,119
her encountering the scarecrow who wants

3210
02:02:27,119 --> 02:02:29,280
a brain representing thoughts

3211
02:02:29,280 --> 02:02:30,800
the tin man who wants a heart

3212
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:32,800
representing emotions, heart-based

3213
02:02:32,800 --> 02:02:34,000
intelligence

3214
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,639
and then the cowardly lion wanting

3215
02:02:36,639 --> 02:02:40,239
courage representing the will to act

3216
02:02:40,239 --> 02:02:44,000
in the world through his will rightly

3217
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,480
thought, emotion, action

3218
02:02:46,480 --> 02:02:48,639
not hard to figure out if you look at it

3219
02:02:48,639 --> 02:02:50,000
from a

3220
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,960
allegorical symbolic perspective

3221
02:02:52,960 --> 02:02:56,320
and a perspective of an occult tradition

3222
02:02:56,320 --> 02:02:58,239
most people see this as just a simple

3223
02:02:58,239 --> 02:03:00,880
child's tale which it is not, it is about

3224
02:03:00,880 --> 02:03:03,920
the unification of consciousness

3225
02:03:03,920 --> 02:03:06,000
and that unification

3226
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,480
brings enlightenment, the word for light

3227
02:03:08,480 --> 02:03:11,040
and the sun depicted there by the circle

3228
02:03:11,040 --> 02:03:13,199
and the dot

3229
02:03:13,199 --> 02:03:15,360
in the

3230
02:03:15,360 --> 02:03:18,239
egyptian / kemetian tradition was

3231
02:03:18,239 --> 02:03:20,480
"on"

3232
02:03:21,440 --> 02:03:23,360
"on" was the city of the sun - literally

3233
02:03:23,360 --> 02:03:26,239
heliopolis

3234
02:03:27,599 --> 02:03:29,520
and enlightenment is the light of the

3235
02:03:29,520 --> 02:03:32,080
mind turning... being turned on

3236
02:03:32,080 --> 02:03:34,320
you know, flicking the switch

3237
02:03:34,320 --> 02:03:36,000
to the "on" position

3238
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,800
illumination

3239
02:03:39,440 --> 02:03:41,679
and we reverse those letters

3240
02:03:41,679 --> 02:03:44,560
it's a mirror for the word "no"

3241
02:03:44,560 --> 02:03:47,440
the lost word of freemasonry

3242
02:03:47,440 --> 02:03:50,000
the word "no"

3243
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,480
is the word of all power whereby we take

3244
02:03:52,480 --> 02:03:54,560
back our power and our rights from

3245
02:03:54,560 --> 02:03:57,360
usurpers, from dark occultists, from

3246
02:03:57,360 --> 02:03:59,440
people who think that there are masters

3247
02:03:59,440 --> 02:04:01,520
who would dare to say that they're the

3248
02:04:01,520 --> 02:04:05,119
masters and owners of other people

3249
02:04:07,280 --> 02:04:09,760
"no" is the word by which we will take our

3250
02:04:09,760 --> 02:04:12,079
rights and our freedom back

3251
02:04:12,079 --> 02:04:14,239
when we refuse to cooperate in any form

3252
02:04:14,239 --> 02:04:17,679
with evil, when we refuse to budge one

3253
02:04:17,679 --> 02:04:20,239
millimeter of ground for evil

3254
02:04:20,239 --> 02:04:22,719
when we have no tolerance for evil

3255
02:04:22,719 --> 02:04:24,480
creeping into our lives and taking

3256
02:04:24,480 --> 02:04:26,079
ground in our lives

3257
02:04:26,079 --> 02:04:27,920
and that is what "liber oz" is ultimately

3258
02:04:27,920 --> 02:04:30,000
all about

3259
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:31,520
once again, people won't hear it

3260
02:04:31,520 --> 02:04:32,560
correctly

3261
02:04:32,560 --> 02:04:34,800
if it's not for you - you probably won't

3262
02:04:34,800 --> 02:04:37,119
understand it, you'll probably insist you

3263
02:04:37,119 --> 02:04:38,880
have a better interpretation than what

3264
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:41,119
it really means, but we'll read it and

3265
02:04:41,119 --> 02:04:42,960
reflect what it really means, regardless

3266
02:04:42,960 --> 02:04:45,440
of what you or anyone else thinks

3267
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:46,880
i'm going to give people the truth of

3268
02:04:46,880 --> 02:04:49,360
what something really actually means and

3269
02:04:49,360 --> 02:04:52,639
represents in the real world

3270
02:04:52,639 --> 02:04:54,480
if you have a different interpretation

3271
02:04:54,480 --> 02:04:56,880
of what i'm really about to lay out - i'm

3272
02:04:56,880 --> 02:04:58,320
going to tell you - you're simply wrong

3273
02:04:58,320 --> 02:05:00,639
i've studied it more in depth than you, i

3274
02:05:00,639 --> 02:05:02,960
understand it better, i have the correct

3275
02:05:02,960 --> 02:05:04,320
interpretation, and i have the

3276
02:05:04,320 --> 02:05:06,159
interpretation by which it was actually

3277
02:05:06,159 --> 02:05:08,560
meant to be distributed and given out

3278
02:05:08,560 --> 02:05:11,360
into the world from the thelemic

3279
02:05:11,360 --> 02:05:13,119
philosophy point of view as the

3280
02:05:13,119 --> 02:05:15,040
manifesto of thelema

3281
02:05:15,040 --> 02:05:16,560
i don't really give a shit whether you

3282
02:05:16,560 --> 02:05:18,159
believe that or not - you could accept

3283
02:05:18,159 --> 02:05:22,079
that or not accept it - it's still true

3284
02:05:22,079 --> 02:05:22,880
so,

3285
02:05:22,880 --> 02:05:25,040
i'm gonna come right at people like that

3286
02:05:25,040 --> 02:05:27,199
with a hard-ass

3287
02:05:27,199 --> 02:05:30,880
in your face confrontative mode

3288
02:05:30,880 --> 02:05:32,320
because there are certain things that

3289
02:05:32,320 --> 02:05:34,719
are just objectively true, and people

3290
02:05:34,719 --> 02:05:36,560
want to refute them, and want to try to

3291
02:05:36,560 --> 02:05:38,800
say that they're not, and they're just

3292
02:05:38,800 --> 02:05:40,400
wrong

3293
02:05:40,400 --> 02:05:42,880
and it's because they're just dumb, and

3294
02:05:42,880 --> 02:05:45,199
they haven't looked at it deeply enough

3295
02:05:45,199 --> 02:05:47,360
and they haven't studied it obsessively

3296
02:05:47,360 --> 02:05:50,719
enough to understand the real meaning

3297
02:05:50,719 --> 02:05:53,520
so, let's clear it up once and for all

3298
02:05:53,520 --> 02:05:55,280
let's put it out there once and for all

3299
02:05:55,280 --> 02:05:57,920
for all the fucking dunces out there

3300
02:05:57,920 --> 02:06:00,079
this is what "liber oz" really means, this

3301
02:06:00,079 --> 02:06:02,800
is what it really is about

3302
02:06:02,800 --> 02:06:06,000
pay attention and you'll learn something

3303
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
empty the mind

3304
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:09,840
get all the chatter out about the mind

3305
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:11,280
about what you've been told and about

3306
02:06:11,280 --> 02:06:13,760
what you think you know

3307
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:15,760
you've probably been told from people

3308
02:06:15,760 --> 02:06:18,159
who don't know shit

3309
02:06:18,159 --> 02:06:20,079
and who think they know

3310
02:06:20,079 --> 02:06:22,320
and they're as dumb as dog shit about

3311
02:06:22,320 --> 02:06:25,199
what they think they know

3312
02:06:25,199 --> 02:06:27,840
as opposed to people who are real

3313
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:28,960
students

3314
02:06:28,960 --> 02:06:31,760
and borderline obsessive students about

3315
02:06:31,760 --> 02:06:34,719
it, that delve into it so deeply until

3316
02:06:34,719 --> 02:06:36,000
they get to the point where they

3317
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
definitively know

3318
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:39,920
this is what it means to drink deeply

3319
02:06:39,920 --> 02:06:42,400
from the pierian spring of knowledge

3320
02:06:42,400 --> 02:06:44,800
not to sip from it

3321
02:06:44,800 --> 02:06:46,079
to

3322
02:06:46,079 --> 02:06:47,360
be

3323
02:06:47,360 --> 02:06:52,079
filled with that essence of knowledge

3324
02:06:53,599 --> 02:06:56,560
through obsessive borderline hard work

3325
02:06:56,560 --> 02:06:58,960
and taking in eclectic varieties of

3326
02:06:58,960 --> 02:07:00,639
information

3327
02:07:00,639 --> 02:07:03,360
and applying the trivium process to it

3328
02:07:03,360 --> 02:07:05,599
so, let's

3329
02:07:05,599 --> 02:07:07,760
read the thelemic manifesto and break it

3330
02:07:07,760 --> 02:07:10,960
down philosophically

3331
02:07:11,280 --> 02:07:13,440
he starts with quotes and ends with

3332
02:07:13,440 --> 02:07:15,280
quotes from the book of the law, "liber

3333
02:07:15,280 --> 02:07:18,280
al vel legis"

3334
02:07:18,480 --> 02:07:20,159
which

3335
02:07:20,159 --> 02:07:24,000
is the expanded

3336
02:07:24,079 --> 02:07:26,719
thelemic philosophy

3337
02:07:26,719 --> 02:07:29,360
the book which defined thelema, you could

3338
02:07:29,360 --> 02:07:30,719
say

3339
02:07:30,719 --> 02:07:33,840
very allegorical, very numerological

3340
02:07:33,840 --> 02:07:36,800
very symbolic

3341
02:07:37,040 --> 02:07:38,719
he lays out

3342
02:07:38,719 --> 02:07:41,599
pretty much natural law in that, he lays

3343
02:07:41,599 --> 02:07:43,199
out what the true will is, he lays out

3344
02:07:43,199 --> 02:07:45,679
true love, he lays out his pantheon of

3345
02:07:45,679 --> 02:07:47,920
gods, characters which represent

3346
02:07:47,920 --> 02:07:49,360
archetypal

3347
02:07:49,360 --> 02:07:52,159
aspects of the personality and of nature

3348
02:07:52,159 --> 02:07:54,560
which could be seen as even corollaries

3349
02:07:54,560 --> 02:07:56,320
to the

3350
02:07:57,920 --> 02:08:00,560
major arcana of the tarot

3351
02:08:00,560 --> 02:08:02,079
and or

3352
02:08:02,079 --> 02:08:04,239
the sefiroth on the tree of life in

3353
02:08:04,239 --> 02:08:05,679
kabbalah

3354
02:08:05,679 --> 02:08:07,760
you could see tons of correspondences to

3355
02:08:07,760 --> 02:08:11,440
all that by studying the book of the law

3356
02:08:11,440 --> 02:08:14,800
which we'll touch on a little bit later

3357
02:08:14,800 --> 02:08:16,560
but, let's read this - he starts with

3358
02:08:16,560 --> 02:08:18,159
quotes from book of the law, "liber

3359
02:08:18,159 --> 02:08:20,560
al vel legis"

3360
02:08:20,560 --> 02:08:21,679
and

3361
02:08:21,679 --> 02:08:24,239
he says

3362
02:08:25,119 --> 02:08:27,760
"the law of the strong

3363
02:08:27,760 --> 02:08:29,679
this is our law

3364
02:08:29,679 --> 02:08:32,639
and the joy of the world"

3365
02:08:32,639 --> 02:08:35,040
so, once again

3366
02:08:35,040 --> 02:08:37,040
he's delineating between people with

3367
02:08:37,040 --> 02:08:40,480
knowledge and people without knowledge

3368
02:08:40,480 --> 02:08:42,239
"the law of the strong"

3369
02:08:42,239 --> 02:08:45,440
literally means "the strong are those

3370
02:08:45,440 --> 02:08:46,719
who

3371
02:08:46,719 --> 02:08:49,280
have truly understood how natural law

3372
02:08:49,280 --> 02:08:51,840
operates"

3373
02:08:53,440 --> 02:08:55,440
the weak are going to be people that

3374
02:08:55,440 --> 02:08:57,679
insist it doesn't exist and or are

3375
02:08:57,679 --> 02:08:59,920
ignorant of its operation and, so, their

3376
02:08:59,920 --> 02:09:01,760
life is going to be chaotic

3377
02:09:01,760 --> 02:09:03,360
they're going to be constantly

3378
02:09:03,360 --> 02:09:06,400
encountering the choronzon energy

3379
02:09:06,400 --> 02:09:08,560
they're not going to get in touch with

3380
02:09:08,560 --> 02:09:09,360
the

3381
02:09:09,360 --> 02:09:11,920
holy guardian angel

3382
02:09:11,920 --> 02:09:13,280
they're not going to get in touch with

3383
02:09:13,280 --> 02:09:14,719
the true will

3384
02:09:14,719 --> 02:09:16,840
and every action is going to

3385
02:09:16,840 --> 02:09:20,079
be a war

3386
02:09:20,079 --> 02:09:21,760
every action is going to be something

3387
02:09:21,760 --> 02:09:22,880
that

3388
02:09:22,880 --> 02:09:24,320
gets in their way

3389
02:09:24,320 --> 02:09:27,440
and acts as a hindrance

3390
02:09:27,440 --> 02:09:29,199
and holds them back

3391
02:09:29,199 --> 02:09:31,679
and constrains them

3392
02:09:31,679 --> 02:09:35,520
and doesn't open their potential

3393
02:09:35,520 --> 02:09:37,280
and that's why certain people, when they

3394
02:09:37,280 --> 02:09:40,000
work with this information, they become

3395
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,639
stronger spiritually, life opens up

3396
02:09:42,639 --> 02:09:45,840
potentiality opens up, manifestation

3397
02:09:45,840 --> 02:09:48,560
starts to flow

3398
02:09:48,560 --> 02:09:50,560
they step into the slipstream of

3399
02:09:50,560 --> 02:09:51,679
creation

3400
02:09:51,679 --> 02:09:54,159
and... by doing the true will

3401
02:09:54,159 --> 02:09:56,159
by living the selfish will

3402
02:09:56,159 --> 02:09:58,639
you're assisting the dark force

3403
02:09:58,639 --> 02:10:00,400
the entropic force

3404
02:10:00,400 --> 02:10:02,320
the force of involution that holds us

3405
02:10:02,320 --> 02:10:04,480
back

3406
02:10:04,480 --> 02:10:06,159
and he's saying

3407
02:10:06,159 --> 02:10:08,239
"knowing this, this is the joy of the

3408
02:10:08,239 --> 02:10:10,159
world"

3409
02:10:10,159 --> 02:10:11,599
really truly

3410
02:10:11,599 --> 02:10:13,679
receiving natural law

3411
02:10:13,679 --> 02:10:16,400
is the good news

3412
02:10:16,400 --> 02:10:19,040
it should be reason to actually be happy

3413
02:10:19,040 --> 02:10:21,360
to celebrate, to be

3414
02:10:21,360 --> 02:10:23,199
in a state of gratitude

3415
02:10:23,199 --> 02:10:26,000
i'm not in gratitude about the situation

3416
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:30,800
around me, right, that's horror

3417
02:10:30,800 --> 02:10:33,599
situation of the real world, the events

3418
02:10:33,599 --> 02:10:35,679
going on in the world is horror

3419
02:10:35,679 --> 02:10:38,239
it's a horrible place, it's in a horrible

3420
02:10:38,239 --> 02:10:40,079
condition

3421
02:10:40,079 --> 02:10:42,320
but the "joy of the world" and the

3422
02:10:42,320 --> 02:10:45,199
gratitude that one can feel internally

3423
02:10:45,199 --> 02:10:46,719
is that

3424
02:10:46,719 --> 02:10:48,239
i personally

3425
02:10:48,239 --> 02:10:51,760
as an individuated monad, an individuated

3426
02:10:51,760 --> 02:10:54,239
aspect of consciousness, am not in that

3427
02:10:54,239 --> 02:10:57,280
level of ignorance, the good news is that

3428
02:10:57,280 --> 02:10:59,440
i understand how it really operates, i

3429
02:10:59,440 --> 02:11:02,159
understand the real working

3430
02:11:02,159 --> 02:11:04,239
and i can align my behavior to it and

3431
02:11:04,239 --> 02:11:06,960
prosper, i can align my behavior to it and

3432
02:11:06,960 --> 02:11:10,079
evolve and grow, and not be like the weak

3433
02:11:10,079 --> 02:11:12,719
not be like the people who are remaining

3434
02:11:12,719 --> 02:11:14,800
in abject willful ignorance, and the only

3435
02:11:14,800 --> 02:11:16,719
people they're hurting is themselves, but

3436
02:11:16,719 --> 02:11:18,400
they are hurting others, actually - it's

3437
02:11:18,400 --> 02:11:19,520
not really the only people they're

3438
02:11:19,520 --> 02:11:21,360
hurting, you could say that as a phrase

3439
02:11:21,360 --> 02:11:23,119
like you're just creating suffering for

3440
02:11:23,119 --> 02:11:25,040
yourself, but the real answer is - they're

3441
02:11:25,040 --> 02:11:26,400
creating suffering not only for

3442
02:11:26,400 --> 02:11:28,159
themselves, but for other people around

3443
02:11:28,159 --> 02:11:30,000
them, because, unfortunately, we are

3444
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,960
connected together as the law of 1

3445
02:11:32,960 --> 02:11:35,440
dictates

3446
02:11:35,440 --> 02:11:37,040
see, if everybody could just go to their

3447
02:11:37,040 --> 02:11:38,960
own place and be as ignorant as they

3448
02:11:38,960 --> 02:11:41,280
want, live as enslaved as you want - great

3449
02:11:41,280 --> 02:11:43,280
go ahead and do it, unfortunately, that's

3450
02:11:43,280 --> 02:11:45,599
not the issue, that's why i have a moral

3451
02:11:45,599 --> 02:11:47,360
problem with it, because you're connected to

3452
02:11:47,360 --> 02:11:49,199
me, you're connected with other people

3453
02:11:49,199 --> 02:11:52,800
who do want freedom, who do want justice

3454
02:11:52,800 --> 02:11:55,119
and that ignorance is a source of harm

3455
02:11:55,119 --> 02:11:56,639
it's a source of

3456
02:11:56,639 --> 02:11:58,800
creating negative

3457
02:11:58,800 --> 02:12:00,960
manifested expressions in the world for

3458
02:12:00,960 --> 02:12:03,360
others, not just for yourself, because we

3459
02:12:03,360 --> 02:12:05,760
are all connected

3460
02:12:05,760 --> 02:12:07,599
but the good news is

3461
02:12:07,599 --> 02:12:10,880
we are the ones doing that, and if we

3462
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:13,679
do get on the same page by an act of our

3463
02:12:13,679 --> 02:12:15,119
will

3464
02:12:15,119 --> 02:12:16,960
and by the act of the will of people who

3465
02:12:16,960 --> 02:12:18,880
do know it, and then teach it to others

3466
02:12:18,880 --> 02:12:21,840
and make our voices heard

3467
02:12:21,840 --> 02:12:24,719
the good news is - we can change it

3468
02:12:24,719 --> 02:12:26,960
this isn't being done to us

3469
02:12:26,960 --> 02:12:29,360
we are doing it to ourselves, and that's

3470
02:12:29,360 --> 02:12:33,520
coming up later in this document

3471
02:12:33,520 --> 02:12:35,520
next he says "do what thou wilt shall be

3472
02:12:35,520 --> 02:12:37,119
the whole of the law", and, of course, we've

3473
02:12:37,119 --> 02:12:40,480
talked about what that means, align your

3474
02:12:40,480 --> 02:12:43,360
will to the will of creation, and forces

3475
02:12:43,360 --> 02:12:45,199
of creation will come to your assistance

3476
02:12:45,199 --> 02:12:46,719
and

3477
02:12:46,719 --> 02:12:48,719
obstacles will be removed from your life

3478
02:12:48,719 --> 02:12:50,880
path, if you find that true purpose and

3479
02:12:50,880 --> 02:12:53,119
path in life

3480
02:12:53,119 --> 02:12:55,280
and right now that's the same

3481
02:12:55,280 --> 02:12:57,760
for everyone here, it's not - they'll say

3482
02:12:57,760 --> 02:13:00,719
it's a unique expression, but right

3483
02:13:00,719 --> 02:13:02,800
now the end goal is the same for

3484
02:13:02,800 --> 02:13:05,520
everybody - you could do it differently

3485
02:13:05,520 --> 02:13:08,239
but you're attempting to create the same

3486
02:13:08,239 --> 02:13:10,320
end result, which is the great work

3487
02:13:10,320 --> 02:13:12,800
of ending slavery

3488
02:13:12,800 --> 02:13:14,800
because if slavery is present - why would

3489
02:13:14,800 --> 02:13:16,960
you ever want to do anything else ?

3490
02:13:16,960 --> 02:13:18,800
if slavery is present the number one

3491
02:13:18,800 --> 02:13:20,320
thing you have to do is free yourself

3492
02:13:20,320 --> 02:13:22,480
and get out of slavery, and if your

3493
02:13:22,480 --> 02:13:25,920
actions are aligned to any other result

3494
02:13:25,920 --> 02:13:27,440
the universe is not going to be good to

3495
02:13:27,440 --> 02:13:28,560
you, it's not going to create

3496
02:13:28,560 --> 02:13:31,040
effortlessness and flow in your life

3497
02:13:31,040 --> 02:13:32,880
because you're saying "i'm okay with

3498
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:35,119
slavery for myself and others"

3499
02:13:35,119 --> 02:13:36,800
and there's no lower form of

3500
02:13:36,800 --> 02:13:38,239
consciousness, that's not the

3501
02:13:38,239 --> 02:13:41,440
true will, that's not love

3502
02:13:42,639 --> 02:13:44,639
so, all things being equal, as we said, the

3503
02:13:44,639 --> 02:13:47,040
true will could have many different

3504
02:13:47,040 --> 02:13:49,199
end results, and goals, and paths

3505
02:13:49,199 --> 02:13:52,000
and, you know, expressions for everyone

3506
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,239
but when there's slavery taking place

3507
02:13:54,239 --> 02:13:55,520
the true will

3508
02:13:55,520 --> 02:13:57,119
the end goal of the true will is the

3509
02:13:57,119 --> 02:14:00,000
same for everyone - ways of

3510
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,719
of doing it, ways of expressing the true

3511
02:14:02,719 --> 02:14:04,320
will - will be different for each

3512
02:14:04,320 --> 02:14:05,760
individual

3513
02:14:05,760 --> 02:14:08,079
but we're all working toward the same

3514
02:14:08,079 --> 02:14:11,713
end result - freedom

3515
02:14:11,873 --> 02:14:12,400
freedom

3516
02:14:12,400 --> 02:14:13,440
first

3517
02:14:13,440 --> 02:14:16,480
then endless other expressions and, you

3518
02:14:16,480 --> 02:14:18,800
know, differentiation

3519
02:14:18,800 --> 02:14:22,719
but slavery has to go first, folks,

3520
02:14:22,719 --> 02:14:25,760
you know, this idea of government

3521
02:14:25,760 --> 02:14:28,560
is not going to allow humanity to evolve

3522
02:14:28,560 --> 02:14:31,119
to higher levels of expressions in

3523
02:14:31,119 --> 02:14:35,040
consciousness, it wants us stuck here

3524
02:14:35,040 --> 02:14:36,880
forever

3525
02:14:36,880 --> 02:14:40,400
and going backwards and devolving

3526
02:14:40,400 --> 02:14:42,719
you know, and they're waging

3527
02:14:42,719 --> 02:14:46,800
mental-war, psy-war, they're waging bio-

3528
02:14:46,800 --> 02:14:49,360
war, biophysical war, and they're waging

3529
02:14:49,360 --> 02:14:51,920
spiritual war

3530
02:14:51,920 --> 02:14:54,400
3 types of war going on, oh, and if

3531
02:14:54,400 --> 02:14:56,800
they have to they'll wage physical war

3532
02:14:56,800 --> 02:14:59,840
so, you could say - 4

3533
02:15:01,280 --> 02:15:04,560
there's spiritual war ultimately

3534
02:15:04,560 --> 02:15:08,000
then there's psy-war, war in the mind

3535
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:09,760
you know

3536
02:15:09,760 --> 02:15:10,960
you could say, there's emotional

3537
02:15:10,960 --> 02:15:13,040
manipulation, there's, you know, emotive

3538
02:15:13,040 --> 02:15:15,280
war

3539
02:15:18,800 --> 02:15:21,199
and there's biophysical war, through all

3540
02:15:21,199 --> 02:15:23,199
the chemicals that they're bombarding us

3541
02:15:23,199 --> 02:15:24,719
with

3542
02:15:24,719 --> 02:15:27,440
frequencies

3543
02:15:27,599 --> 02:15:29,920
so, you have psy-war, you have bio-war, and

3544
02:15:29,920 --> 02:15:32,639
you have physical war

3545
02:15:32,639 --> 02:15:34,639
all being used

3546
02:15:34,639 --> 02:15:37,199
and employed by the dark occultists

3547
02:15:37,199 --> 02:15:39,599
to keep us in this

3548
02:15:39,599 --> 02:15:41,840
hell world, this prison that we've built

3549
02:15:41,840 --> 02:15:44,560
for ourselves

3550
02:15:44,880 --> 02:15:47,360
so, we talked about "do what thou wilt"

3551
02:15:47,360 --> 02:15:48,639
aligning

3552
02:15:48,639 --> 02:15:50,960
our own will to the will of creation

3553
02:15:50,960 --> 02:15:52,639
doing the true will

3554
02:15:52,639 --> 02:15:55,119
to then

3555
02:15:55,119 --> 02:15:57,040
actually, accomplish the great work of

3556
02:15:57,040 --> 02:16:00,400
ending human slavery here on earth

3557
02:16:00,400 --> 02:16:02,880
the next line from

3558
02:16:02,880 --> 02:16:05,360
the book of the law is

3559
02:16:05,360 --> 02:16:08,079
"thou hast no right but to do thy will, do

3560
02:16:08,079 --> 02:16:10,719
that and no other shall say nay"

3561
02:16:10,719 --> 02:16:13,119
so, once again, this is the idea that to

3562
02:16:13,119 --> 02:16:16,239
do the will is a bond

3563
02:16:16,239 --> 02:16:18,800
it's the strictest possible bond as it's

3564
02:16:18,800 --> 02:16:21,520
been described

3565
02:16:22,159 --> 02:16:25,520
this is the first and utmost utter

3566
02:16:25,520 --> 02:16:27,280
ultimate right

3567
02:16:27,280 --> 02:16:30,239
crowley says "thou has no other right but

3568
02:16:30,239 --> 02:16:31,840
to do the will

3569
02:16:31,840 --> 02:16:33,359
of creation"

3570
02:16:33,359 --> 02:16:35,439
when you start to try to do all your

3571
02:16:35,439 --> 02:16:38,000
other frivolous wants and desires

3572
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,080
and base desires, and just

3573
02:16:40,080 --> 02:16:42,799
fulfill those base

3574
02:16:42,799 --> 02:16:45,599
earthly worldly needs at the

3575
02:16:45,599 --> 02:16:48,398
expense of doing the true will

3576
02:16:48,398 --> 02:16:51,759
all obstacles arise

3577
02:16:52,160 --> 02:16:55,519
he says "do the true will and no other

3578
02:16:55,519 --> 02:16:58,559
shall say nay",

3579
02:16:58,718 --> 02:17:01,120
you won't have resistance in your life

3580
02:17:01,120 --> 02:17:03,519
if your behavior is actually aligned to

3581
02:17:03,519 --> 02:17:06,240
the true will

3582
02:17:07,040 --> 02:17:08,160
and then

3583
02:17:08,160 --> 02:17:10,478
the last quote, before he enters the

3584
02:17:10,478 --> 02:17:12,879
document proper, is

3585
02:17:12,879 --> 02:17:15,760
from the book of the law, once again

3586
02:17:15,760 --> 02:17:20,318
"every man and every woman is a star"

3587
02:17:20,318 --> 02:17:22,160
and so, this is representative of

3588
02:17:22,160 --> 02:17:23,760
sovereignty

3589
02:17:23,760 --> 02:17:25,679
the star, especially the 5-pointed

3590
02:17:25,679 --> 02:17:28,398
star, again, the upright pentacle or

3591
02:17:28,398 --> 02:17:30,959
pentagram has always been seen as the

3592
02:17:30,959 --> 02:17:33,280
symbol of a man or woman

3593
02:17:33,280 --> 02:17:35,200
with the head and the 4 extremities

3594
02:17:35,200 --> 02:17:37,599
the arms and the legs - the arms and legs

3595
02:17:37,599 --> 02:17:39,519
representing earth, air, water and fire

3596
02:17:39,519 --> 02:17:41,200
the physical elements, and then the head

3597
02:17:41,200 --> 02:17:43,519
representing spirit

3598
02:17:43,519 --> 02:17:46,478
the consciousness, the mind

3599
02:17:46,478 --> 02:17:48,879
the 5th element

3600
02:17:48,879 --> 02:17:51,439
and in the hub, in the center, directly

3601
02:17:51,439 --> 02:17:55,479
connected to the heart energy

3602
02:17:57,200 --> 02:17:59,519
and this is what it means, that

3603
02:17:59,519 --> 02:18:02,240
you know, the 50... the 55 pointed

3604
02:18:02,240 --> 02:18:04,160
stars on the american flag represents

3605
02:18:04,160 --> 02:18:07,040
the sovereignty of the 50 states

3606
02:18:07,040 --> 02:18:08,879
and ultimately it should represent the

3607
02:18:08,879 --> 02:18:11,840
sovereignty of the people

3608
02:18:11,840 --> 02:18:13,599
crowley is directly talking about the

3609
02:18:13,599 --> 02:18:15,599
sovereignty of the individual - the star

3610
02:18:15,599 --> 02:18:18,240
has been a traditional archetypal symbol

3611
02:18:18,240 --> 02:18:21,599
of sovereignty for these reasons

3612
02:18:21,599 --> 02:18:23,519
and he's saying "every man and every

3613
02:18:23,519 --> 02:18:26,478
woman is a sovereign being"

3614
02:18:26,478 --> 02:18:29,040
a star symbolically

3615
02:18:29,040 --> 02:18:30,879
and then in the kemetian or the

3616
02:18:30,879 --> 02:18:34,240
ancient egyptian tradition

3617
02:18:34,240 --> 02:18:37,359
their concept of dying and going into

3618
02:18:37,359 --> 02:18:39,439
the duat

3619
02:18:39,439 --> 02:18:42,160
the egyptian underworld

3620
02:18:42,160 --> 02:18:44,318
they would encounter

3621
02:18:44,318 --> 02:18:47,678
the testing of the soul

3622
02:18:47,840 --> 02:18:50,000
whereby you went into the chamber of the

3623
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,398
goddess ma'at

3624
02:18:52,398 --> 02:18:54,879
and anubis guided you there

3625
02:18:54,879 --> 02:18:56,799
the Ferrier of the Dead

3626
02:18:56,799 --> 02:18:59,280
in the duat, and then

3627
02:18:59,280 --> 02:19:01,679
there would be Thoth, the scribe of your

3628
02:19:01,679 --> 02:19:03,519
deeds

3629
02:19:03,519 --> 02:19:05,040
and a scale

3630
02:19:05,040 --> 02:19:07,840
and a heart, and a feather, one of Ma'at's

3631
02:19:07,840 --> 02:19:09,519
feathers

3632
02:19:09,519 --> 02:19:12,000
you know, and then

3633
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:13,599
the heart of the

3634
02:19:13,599 --> 02:19:15,040
soul of the dead would be weighed

3635
02:19:15,040 --> 02:19:17,920
against the feather

3636
02:19:18,558 --> 02:19:21,519
and if it was as light or lighter than

3637
02:19:21,519 --> 02:19:24,718
the feather, representing that one had

3638
02:19:24,718 --> 02:19:27,760
truly heart-based intelligence and lived

3639
02:19:27,760 --> 02:19:29,760
according to righteousness

3640
02:19:29,760 --> 02:19:31,359
and align their will with the will of

3641
02:19:31,359 --> 02:19:33,439
creation, and align their behavior to

3642
02:19:33,439 --> 02:19:36,000
what was truly objectively right, and

3643
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,478
didn't initiate harm to others

3644
02:19:38,478 --> 02:19:40,638
that is the likeness of the heart

3645
02:19:40,638 --> 02:19:42,558
it doesn't mean you're not... you're just

3646
02:19:42,558 --> 02:19:44,558
light-hearted and giddy, and not serious

3647
02:19:44,558 --> 02:19:46,478
all the time - that's not what it means

3648
02:19:46,478 --> 02:19:48,318
lightheartedness in this aspect meant

3649
02:19:48,318 --> 02:19:50,160
that your heart was pure from a

3650
02:19:50,160 --> 02:19:52,479
perspective of you looked at deeds that

3651
02:19:52,479 --> 02:19:54,720
were harmful, that you may have engaged

3652
02:19:54,720 --> 02:19:56,720
in previously, you desisted in that, you

3653
02:19:56,720 --> 02:19:58,640
repented for that, you didn't engage in

3654
02:19:58,640 --> 02:20:00,240
those practices anymore, and then your

3655
02:20:00,240 --> 02:20:03,280
heart became light

3656
02:20:03,280 --> 02:20:06,399
beautiful allegorical symbolism

3657
02:20:06,399 --> 02:20:08,080
if the heart on the other hand was

3658
02:20:08,080 --> 02:20:10,319
impure and outweighs the feather

3659
02:20:10,319 --> 02:20:12,560
it goes into the mouth of Amit, the

3660
02:20:12,560 --> 02:20:16,000
destroyer, like crocodile type spirit

3661
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
and then you were recycled back into the

3662
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:19,520
world until you learned the lessons you

3663
02:20:19,520 --> 02:20:22,160
needed to, if on the other hand you did

3664
02:20:22,160 --> 02:20:24,319
not, you were given the choice

3665
02:20:24,319 --> 02:20:26,160
do you want to go and help others or do

3666
02:20:26,160 --> 02:20:28,800
you want to go out into the wider world

3667
02:20:28,800 --> 02:20:30,640
of the universe and experience life from

3668
02:20:30,640 --> 02:20:33,040
a different level of consciousness, and

3669
02:20:33,040 --> 02:20:35,600
it was said, that if one chose that path

3670
02:20:35,600 --> 02:20:40,000
they extended out of, you know

3671
02:20:41,040 --> 02:20:42,960
through light into other areas of the

3672
02:20:42,960 --> 02:20:45,600
cosmos and you are reborn

3673
02:20:45,600 --> 02:20:48,160
as a star somewhere else in another

3674
02:20:48,160 --> 02:20:50,800
solar system, and that you

3675
02:20:50,800 --> 02:20:52,560
because you learned those lessons, could

3676
02:20:52,560 --> 02:20:53,359
help

3677
02:20:53,359 --> 02:20:55,520
through the light of that star

3678
02:20:55,520 --> 02:20:58,960
act as a beacon of enlightenment for

3679
02:20:58,960 --> 02:21:00,479
other souls

3680
02:21:00,479 --> 02:21:03,040
that would then be satellites of

3681
02:21:03,040 --> 02:21:05,680
yourself in a new solar system

3682
02:21:05,680 --> 02:21:08,160
so, it's a beautiful

3683
02:21:08,160 --> 02:21:10,319
allegorical

3684
02:21:10,319 --> 02:21:13,680
tradition and story from the ancient

3685
02:21:13,680 --> 02:21:17,920
egyptian, again, the kemetian tradition

3686
02:21:17,920 --> 02:21:20,479
and, again, crowley's referencing it here

3687
02:21:20,479 --> 02:21:23,200
by saying "every man and woman is a

3688
02:21:23,200 --> 02:21:24,560
star"

3689
02:21:24,560 --> 02:21:26,479
we have the potential to

3690
02:21:26,479 --> 02:21:29,120
have that type of light within us and be

3691
02:21:29,120 --> 02:21:32,720
reborn in that, again, that egyptian

3692
02:21:32,720 --> 02:21:36,399
cosmology as a star, literally, which

3693
02:21:36,399 --> 02:21:38,640
represents sovereignty, the stars of the

3694
02:21:38,640 --> 02:21:41,359
night sky of Nuit's cloak

3695
02:21:41,359 --> 02:21:42,960
you know, represents

3696
02:21:42,960 --> 02:21:44,560
sovereign beings

3697
02:21:44,560 --> 02:21:47,120
under the creator of the universe, god's

3698
02:21:47,120 --> 02:21:49,120
sons and daughters

3699
02:21:49,120 --> 02:21:52,240
all sovereign, all equal in our natural

3700
02:21:52,240 --> 02:21:54,000
rights

3701
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,880
all having the potential to project the

3702
02:21:56,880 --> 02:21:59,520
light of the creator of the universe and

3703
02:21:59,520 --> 02:22:03,439
give that to others to create more light

3704
02:22:04,319 --> 02:22:06,319
so, that's just the preamble

3705
02:22:06,319 --> 02:22:07,120
from

3706
02:22:07,120 --> 02:22:09,040
quotes from the book of the law

3707
02:22:09,040 --> 02:22:12,399
now, the document starts in earnest

3708
02:22:12,399 --> 02:22:14,880
"there is no god but man"

3709
02:22:14,880 --> 02:22:16,560
once again, we talked about that, that

3710
02:22:16,560 --> 02:22:19,359
does not mean man is god

3711
02:22:19,359 --> 02:22:21,040
okay, so

3712
02:22:21,040 --> 02:22:22,960
non-initiates

3713
02:22:22,960 --> 02:22:24,800
to the thelemite tradition will

3714
02:22:24,800 --> 02:22:28,240
immediately read that wrongly

3715
02:22:28,240 --> 02:22:30,960
look at it again, it's a small "g"

3716
02:22:30,960 --> 02:22:33,520
in the word "god", and a capital "m" in the

3717
02:22:33,520 --> 02:22:36,160
word "man" - if it were reversed and the "g"

3718
02:22:36,160 --> 02:22:38,319
were capital and the "m" were lower case

3719
02:22:38,319 --> 02:22:39,840
now, you have

3720
02:22:39,840 --> 02:22:42,240
that it's tantamount to blasphemy, it's

3721
02:22:42,240 --> 02:22:44,000
tantamount to claiming to be god, like a

3722
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:47,520
dark occultist, like a satanist

3723
02:22:47,520 --> 02:22:50,640
there is no lower case god creator of

3724
02:22:50,640 --> 02:22:52,720
our experience collectively here on

3725
02:22:52,720 --> 02:22:56,720
earth other than mankind itself, humanity

3726
02:22:56,720 --> 02:22:58,720
itself is

3727
02:22:58,720 --> 02:23:01,120
the creator of its experience through

3728
02:23:01,120 --> 02:23:03,439
consequentialism, through natural law, the

3729
02:23:03,439 --> 02:23:05,520
behavior you put back is what's going to

3730
02:23:05,520 --> 02:23:07,200
trigger the consequences that you

3731
02:23:07,200 --> 02:23:08,720
receive

3732
02:23:08,720 --> 02:23:11,280
not that hard to understand

3733
02:23:11,280 --> 02:23:14,000
natural law in a nutshell right there

3734
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:17,439
there's no lower case "g", small "g" creator

3735
02:23:17,439 --> 02:23:19,600
other than humanity itself

3736
02:23:19,600 --> 02:23:21,520
all human beings in the aggregate

3737
02:23:21,520 --> 02:23:23,200
mankind

3738
02:23:23,200 --> 02:23:24,800
humankind

3739
02:23:24,800 --> 02:23:26,720
i would write that as

3740
02:23:26,720 --> 02:23:28,640
there is no

3741
02:23:28,640 --> 02:23:30,000
creator

3742
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:30,840
of

3743
02:23:30,840 --> 02:23:34,399
humanity's experience other than

3744
02:23:34,399 --> 02:23:36,479
humanity itself

3745
02:23:36,479 --> 02:23:38,960
that's it

3746
02:23:42,080 --> 02:23:44,880
and people will argue this till the end

3747
02:23:44,880 --> 02:23:47,359
of the universe itself, until the stars

3748
02:23:47,359 --> 02:23:50,720
die out of existence, people will say "no,

3749
02:23:50,720 --> 02:23:53,280
i have the better interpretation, and

3750
02:23:53,280 --> 02:23:55,439
you're wrong, Mark, you don't know what

3751
02:23:55,439 --> 02:23:59,359
you're talking about, and i do"

3752
02:23:59,520 --> 02:24:01,680
dumb as a sack of fucking sand, you don't

3753
02:24:01,680 --> 02:24:05,359
know what the fuck you're talking about

3754
02:24:05,359 --> 02:24:07,840
period

3755
02:24:07,840 --> 02:24:10,399
i have the correct interpretation, i'm

3756
02:24:10,399 --> 02:24:12,800
reading it correctly, you are not reading

3757
02:24:12,800 --> 02:24:15,760
it correctly, you are

3758
02:24:15,760 --> 02:24:18,240
ill-read when it comes to the tradition

3759
02:24:18,240 --> 02:24:21,120
of thelema, you are acting in haste

3760
02:24:21,120 --> 02:24:23,280
judgment and speaking something that you

3761
02:24:23,280 --> 02:24:25,280
don't understand, not me

3762
02:24:25,280 --> 02:24:28,000
i understand it and i have it correct

3763
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,960
you are the one who has it wrong

3764
02:24:30,960 --> 02:24:32,160
and again

3765
02:24:32,160 --> 02:24:36,399
believe whatever the fuck you want

3766
02:24:36,399 --> 02:24:38,720
you're still incorrect and i'm still

3767
02:24:38,720 --> 02:24:40,560
telling the truth

3768
02:24:40,560 --> 02:24:43,680
let's get that fucking totally clear

3769
02:24:43,680 --> 02:24:46,080
all right ?

3770
02:24:47,200 --> 02:24:49,840
so, now the document begins in paragraph

3771
02:24:49,840 --> 02:24:52,160
form truly in earnest, that's the

3772
02:24:52,160 --> 02:24:54,319
qualifier at the top

3773
02:24:54,319 --> 02:24:57,120
that this is how natural law works

3774
02:24:57,120 --> 02:24:59,600
we either understand how it works or we

3775
02:24:59,600 --> 02:25:02,240
create unconsciously, but nobody else is

3776
02:25:02,240 --> 02:25:06,319
doing it truly to us from the outside

3777
02:25:06,319 --> 02:25:08,399
we're creating it ourselves, we're

3778
02:25:08,399 --> 02:25:11,200
inflicting the self-inflicted suffering

3779
02:25:11,200 --> 02:25:13,439
by not saying "no" to evil, we're

3780
02:25:13,439 --> 02:25:15,520
inflicting the self-inflicted suffering

3781
02:25:15,520 --> 02:25:17,680
of the human condition by not learning

3782
02:25:17,680 --> 02:25:19,439
objective morality and aligning our

3783
02:25:19,439 --> 02:25:21,920
behavior to it, let's get that clear

3784
02:25:21,920 --> 02:25:24,399
it's not something that is external

3785
02:25:24,399 --> 02:25:26,080
you could talk about the illuminati, you

3786
02:25:26,080 --> 02:25:27,359
could talk about the dark occult, you

3787
02:25:27,359 --> 02:25:30,160
could talk about aliens, all day, every

3788
02:25:30,160 --> 02:25:32,800
day and ultimately they're not

3789
02:25:32,800 --> 02:25:35,520
really the ones in control

3790
02:25:35,520 --> 02:25:37,040
the creator of the universe is

3791
02:25:37,040 --> 02:25:40,000
ultimately in control and that force is

3792
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,319
going to grant us the power we require

3793
02:25:42,319 --> 02:25:43,920
to free ourselves when we get on the

3794
02:25:43,920 --> 02:25:45,600
same fucking page and understand

3795
02:25:45,600 --> 02:25:48,160
objective morality and natural law, align

3796
02:25:48,160 --> 02:25:49,920
our behavior to it through an act of our

3797
02:25:49,920 --> 02:25:53,280
true will and true love, period

3798
02:25:53,280 --> 02:25:54,640
the end

3799
02:25:54,640 --> 02:25:56,560
for all time

3800
02:25:56,560 --> 02:25:58,319
and that's contained in that one

3801
02:25:58,319 --> 02:26:02,000
sentence - there's no god but man

3802
02:26:02,479 --> 02:26:04,800
understand what it means ?

3803
02:26:04,800 --> 02:26:06,800
and then you could correctly truly

3804
02:26:06,800 --> 02:26:09,040
interpret it

3805
02:26:09,040 --> 02:26:11,520
instead of acting in hasty quick

3806
02:26:11,520 --> 02:26:13,120
judgment you thinking you know, and you

3807
02:26:13,120 --> 02:26:15,920
don't know shit

3808
02:26:16,560 --> 02:26:18,319
you know what somebody else told you

3809
02:26:18,319 --> 02:26:20,240
when they were equally just as fucking

3810
02:26:20,240 --> 02:26:22,720
dumb and ill read

3811
02:26:22,720 --> 02:26:24,720
that's the problem with the whole

3812
02:26:24,720 --> 02:26:26,640
thelemic tradition

3813
02:26:26,640 --> 02:26:29,359
i'm gonna try not to get too ultra

3814
02:26:29,359 --> 02:26:30,960
confrontative, but

3815
02:26:30,960 --> 02:26:33,840
it really does piss me off to no end

3816
02:26:33,840 --> 02:26:37,600
when people talk out their ass

3817
02:26:37,600 --> 02:26:39,840
and they have no direct knowledge of the

3818
02:26:39,840 --> 02:26:41,760
thing, they've never studied it, they've

3819
02:26:41,760 --> 02:26:43,280
never read it in depth, and let me tell

3820
02:26:43,280 --> 02:26:45,280
you something, you can't just read this

3821
02:26:45,280 --> 02:26:47,040
and think you understand thelema, first

3822
02:26:47,040 --> 02:26:48,479
of all

3823
02:26:48,479 --> 02:26:50,880
i'm presenting you, again, this whole

3824
02:26:50,880 --> 02:26:51,920
series

3825
02:26:51,920 --> 02:26:53,200
on this

3826
02:26:53,200 --> 02:26:55,840
occult tradition, is to simply wet your

3827
02:26:55,840 --> 02:26:58,479
appetite to really read into it, on your

3828
02:26:58,479 --> 02:26:59,760
own

3829
02:26:59,760 --> 02:27:01,439
obviously, if we really did that it would

3830
02:27:01,439 --> 02:27:04,479
be 50 to 100 shows or more

3831
02:27:04,479 --> 02:27:05,920
you know, the whole

3832
02:27:05,920 --> 02:27:07,600
what on earth is happening podcast

3833
02:27:07,600 --> 02:27:09,040
series is not just going to be on

3834
02:27:09,040 --> 02:27:11,120
thelema nor is it just going to be on

3835
02:27:11,120 --> 02:27:14,000
freemasonry or just on rosicrucianism

3836
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,319
we've touched on these topics, but you

3837
02:27:16,319 --> 02:27:17,920
have to do the reading yourself, i could

3838
02:27:17,920 --> 02:27:20,000
point you to the books, but you got to

3839
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:21,600
read them and understand them, you have

3840
02:27:21,600 --> 02:27:22,640
to read

3841
02:27:22,640 --> 02:27:24,399
other interpretations, you have to read

3842
02:27:24,399 --> 02:27:26,720
biographies and autobiographies and the

3843
02:27:26,720 --> 02:27:27,920
the actual

3844
02:27:27,920 --> 02:27:29,120
philosophy

3845
02:27:29,120 --> 02:27:31,840
from those who formulated it

3846
02:27:31,840 --> 02:27:34,160
and i don't mean just a piece of it

3847
02:27:34,160 --> 02:27:36,479
you know, this is the concretence of it

3848
02:27:36,479 --> 02:27:38,880
in one document

3849
02:27:38,880 --> 02:27:40,880
that's not going to get you there

3850
02:27:40,880 --> 02:27:43,280
you got to read all of the details and

3851
02:27:43,280 --> 02:27:45,520
minutiae of it, and go over it multiple

3852
02:27:45,520 --> 02:27:48,160
times understand it

3853
02:27:48,160 --> 02:27:51,439
this is what the serious student does

3854
02:27:51,439 --> 02:27:53,040
they don't read one thing and think they

3855
02:27:53,040 --> 02:27:56,080
understand it, they read all of it and

3856
02:27:56,080 --> 02:27:58,640
then go over it multiple times until

3857
02:27:58,640 --> 02:28:01,359
they gain a deep understanding of it

3858
02:28:01,359 --> 02:28:04,160
see, that's what eclectic and obsessive

3859
02:28:04,160 --> 02:28:06,800
research and study really is

3860
02:28:06,800 --> 02:28:10,840
you exhaust the topic

3861
02:28:12,800 --> 02:28:14,479
most people won't do that, because it's

3862
02:28:14,479 --> 02:28:17,760
an incredible investment of time

3863
02:28:17,760 --> 02:28:20,880
and effort, and energy, and sacrifice

3864
02:28:20,880 --> 02:28:22,800
and that's what love is

3865
02:28:22,800 --> 02:28:24,560
making that effort

3866
02:28:24,560 --> 02:28:27,520
that's why they call it a labor of love

3867
02:28:27,520 --> 02:28:31,280
to make that effort is to do the will

3868
02:28:31,840 --> 02:28:34,479
to exercise that form of agape-love

3869
02:28:34,479 --> 02:28:37,200
higher love, higher consciousness love

3870
02:28:37,200 --> 02:28:40,880
unconditional universal love for truth

3871
02:28:40,880 --> 02:28:42,880
for justice, for knowledge, for how things

3872
02:28:42,880 --> 02:28:44,640
really work, for natural law, for

3873
02:28:44,640 --> 02:28:46,399
objective morality

3874
02:28:46,399 --> 02:28:48,240
is thelema

3875
02:28:48,240 --> 02:28:50,000
to use the will

3876
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:53,200
to put your path in life on the ultimate

3877
02:28:53,200 --> 02:28:57,920
universal path of the creation's will

3878
02:28:57,920 --> 02:29:00,080
very, very, very few people aligning with

3879
02:29:00,080 --> 02:29:04,560
that path, very few people understand thelema from that perspective, even people

3880
02:29:04,560 --> 02:29:06,479
calling themselves thelemites don't

3881
02:29:06,479 --> 02:29:07,680
understand it, because you know what they

3882
02:29:07,680 --> 02:29:11,680
are ? they're fucking crowleyites

3883
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
they're

3884
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:17,280
paying reverence and homage to the man

3885
02:29:17,280 --> 02:29:20,240
instead of to the philosophy, instead of

3886
02:29:20,240 --> 02:29:23,200
to the principles that are conveyed

3887
02:29:23,200 --> 02:29:24,880
and that doesn't make one a thelemite

3888
02:29:24,880 --> 02:29:27,600
that makes one a jackass

3889
02:29:27,600 --> 02:29:29,760
all right, let's get that clear

3890
02:29:29,760 --> 02:29:31,920
to all the so-called to the fake-ass

3891
02:29:31,920 --> 02:29:33,280
thelemites out there, because, again

3892
02:29:33,280 --> 02:29:35,280
there's fake-ass anarchists, there's fake-ass

3893
02:29:35,280 --> 02:29:38,720
freemasons, there's fake-ass rosicrucians, there's fake-ass christians

3894
02:29:38,720 --> 02:29:40,640
there's fake-ass muslims, there's fake

3895
02:29:40,640 --> 02:29:43,920
ass jews, there's fake-ass thelemites

3896
02:29:43,920 --> 02:29:45,680
that don't know a goddamn thing about

3897
02:29:45,680 --> 02:29:47,520
thelema

3898
02:29:47,520 --> 02:29:49,840
they want to impress somebody by

3899
02:29:49,840 --> 02:29:52,000
getting all involved in the trappings of

3900
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:53,840
it, and the rituals, and going to the

3901
02:29:53,840 --> 02:29:56,720
lodge system, oh, i'm so into crowley

3902
02:29:56,720 --> 02:29:58,479
who gives a fuck ?

3903
02:29:58,479 --> 02:30:00,479
do you know what thelema really is ?

3904
02:30:00,479 --> 02:30:02,160
could you explain the tradition the way

3905
02:30:02,160 --> 02:30:04,640
i did into two episodes in less than two

3906
02:30:04,640 --> 02:30:05,920
episodes ?

3907
02:30:05,920 --> 02:30:08,399
probably not

3908
02:30:08,399 --> 02:30:09,760
which means

3909
02:30:09,760 --> 02:30:12,080
you really don't know shit

3910
02:30:12,080 --> 02:30:13,760
and you haven't really gotten it from a

3911
02:30:13,760 --> 02:30:17,080
deep perspective

3912
02:30:20,080 --> 02:30:22,080
so, let's now read the paragraphs of

3913
02:30:22,080 --> 02:30:25,840
liber oz and break them down

3914
02:30:26,160 --> 02:30:27,920
paragraph one

3915
02:30:27,920 --> 02:30:31,520
man has the right, capital "r", to live by

3916
02:30:31,520 --> 02:30:34,720
his own law, capital "l"

3917
02:30:34,720 --> 02:30:36,399
now that doesn't mean do whatever you

3918
02:30:36,399 --> 02:30:38,080
want

3919
02:30:38,080 --> 02:30:39,520
that means you have the right to live

3920
02:30:39,520 --> 02:30:41,920
according to natural law, capital "l", your

3921
02:30:41,920 --> 02:30:44,000
natural right is

3922
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:45,040
the law

3923
02:30:45,040 --> 02:30:47,439
is natural law

3924
02:30:47,439 --> 02:30:49,840
capital "l"

3925
02:30:49,840 --> 02:30:51,840
so, you have the right to live within the

3926
02:30:51,840 --> 02:30:54,080
boundary conditions of natural law, and

3927
02:30:54,080 --> 02:30:57,200
no one has the right to truly stop you

3928
02:30:57,200 --> 02:30:58,720
from living within those boundary

3929
02:30:58,720 --> 02:31:00,240
conditions, and this is what is done

3930
02:31:00,240 --> 02:31:02,880
criminally all the time by human beings

3931
02:31:02,880 --> 02:31:06,640
because most human beings are thieves

3932
02:31:06,640 --> 02:31:08,640
and other people then support the

3933
02:31:08,640 --> 02:31:11,520
thieves from thieving people's natural

3934
02:31:11,520 --> 02:31:13,680
rights and freedom, and their

3935
02:31:13,680 --> 02:31:15,200
free will

3936
02:31:15,200 --> 02:31:18,640
and coercing them, coercing them

3937
02:31:18,640 --> 02:31:21,840
and putting them under duress

3938
02:31:21,840 --> 02:31:23,680
and ultimately doing physical violence

3939
02:31:23,680 --> 02:31:28,040
to them, initiating harm

3940
02:31:28,080 --> 02:31:30,640
man has the right, capital "r", natural

3941
02:31:30,640 --> 02:31:34,000
rights to live according to natural law

3942
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:35,920
objective morality

3943
02:31:35,920 --> 02:31:38,000
to live in the way that he wills to do

3944
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:41,040
capital "w", will - meaning not doing

3945
02:31:41,040 --> 02:31:45,120
whatever you want but to align your

3946
02:31:45,120 --> 02:31:46,399
way of life

3947
02:31:46,399 --> 02:31:47,359
to

3948
02:31:47,359 --> 02:31:49,280
creation's will

3949
02:31:49,280 --> 02:31:50,640
for

3950
02:31:50,640 --> 02:31:52,960
the beings, the sovereign beings within

3951
02:31:52,960 --> 02:31:54,640
creation, meaning to respect other

3952
02:31:54,640 --> 02:31:57,359
sovereignty, to respect their free will

3953
02:31:57,359 --> 02:32:00,399
to respect their rights, to respect their

3954
02:32:00,399 --> 02:32:02,319
rights to live under natural law free

3955
02:32:02,319 --> 02:32:04,880
from aggression and

3956
02:32:04,880 --> 02:32:07,280
the initiation of harm

3957
02:32:07,280 --> 02:32:11,240
willfully by other people

3958
02:32:11,600 --> 02:32:14,399
so, he's outlining the equality of

3959
02:32:14,399 --> 02:32:16,560
everyone under natural law

3960
02:32:16,560 --> 02:32:18,880
in these first two sentences and saying

3961
02:32:18,880 --> 02:32:20,319
that

3962
02:32:20,319 --> 02:32:22,080
we have no other rights except those

3963
02:32:22,080 --> 02:32:24,880
that are prescribed by natural law

3964
02:32:24,880 --> 02:32:26,160
which means

3965
02:32:26,160 --> 02:32:27,840
don't do the things that are

3966
02:32:27,840 --> 02:32:30,240
transgression against natural law - murder

3967
02:32:30,240 --> 02:32:32,720
assault, rape, theft, trespass, coercion and

3968
02:32:32,720 --> 02:32:34,479
deception

3969
02:32:34,479 --> 02:32:37,439
the true seven deadly sins

3970
02:32:37,439 --> 02:32:39,920
stay out of the areas of those forms of

3971
02:32:39,920 --> 02:32:40,880
theft

3972
02:32:40,880 --> 02:32:41,680
and

3973
02:32:41,680 --> 02:32:43,840
you will be acting within your rights

3974
02:32:43,840 --> 02:32:45,439
and that is what it is your right to do

3975
02:32:45,439 --> 02:32:47,520
under natural law

3976
02:32:47,520 --> 02:32:50,800
not that hard to understand, actually

3977
02:32:50,800 --> 02:32:53,760
you know, people giving it incorrect

3978
02:32:53,760 --> 02:32:55,840
interpretations, because they don't know

3979
02:32:55,840 --> 02:32:57,280
enough

3980
02:32:57,280 --> 02:32:58,800
is the problem

3981
02:32:58,800 --> 02:33:01,040
that's why thelema gets obfuscated, and

3982
02:33:01,040 --> 02:33:02,800
that's what the dark occultists want

3983
02:33:02,800 --> 02:33:04,319
because this is the last thing they want

3984
02:33:04,319 --> 02:33:06,160
anybody understanding, because that's the

3985
02:33:06,160 --> 02:33:08,080
end of their power, that's the end of

3986
02:33:08,080 --> 02:33:10,000
their thrall, that's the end of their

3987
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:13,040
mind control, their dark occult influence

3988
02:33:13,040 --> 02:33:15,359
over the minds of human beings, if people

3989
02:33:15,359 --> 02:33:17,520
truly wake up to the power of a

3990
02:33:17,520 --> 02:33:21,840
philosophical tradition like this

3991
02:33:22,080 --> 02:33:26,960
to work as he will, to play as he will, to

3992
02:33:26,960 --> 02:33:29,840
rest as he will, to die

3993
02:33:29,840 --> 02:33:32,399
when and how he will

3994
02:33:32,399 --> 02:33:34,640
all capital "w"-s all in alignment with

3995
02:33:34,640 --> 02:33:36,880
the true will of creation

3996
02:33:36,880 --> 02:33:38,720
not to do the selfish will in any of

3997
02:33:38,720 --> 02:33:41,280
those things

3998
02:33:42,080 --> 02:33:43,600
totally different from saying - do

3999
02:33:43,600 --> 02:33:45,040
whatever kind of work you want even if

4000
02:33:45,040 --> 02:33:47,040
it doesn't align with natural law

4001
02:33:47,040 --> 02:33:48,960
that's not what is being said in

4002
02:33:48,960 --> 02:33:50,640
liber oz

4003
02:33:50,640 --> 02:33:52,960
right, so, the first form of it to work as

4004
02:33:52,960 --> 02:33:54,800
he will

4005
02:33:54,800 --> 02:33:57,200
that doesn't mean enter any field of

4006
02:33:57,200 --> 02:33:58,640
work that you want

4007
02:33:58,640 --> 02:34:00,319
that means enter a field of work that is

4008
02:34:00,319 --> 02:34:01,920
in alignment with the will of creation

4009
02:34:01,920 --> 02:34:03,920
that is right livelihood

4010
02:34:03,920 --> 02:34:06,960
the buddhist concept of right livelihood

4011
02:34:06,960 --> 02:34:08,720
which we've talked about on what on

4012
02:34:08,720 --> 02:34:12,160
earth is happening in past episodes

4013
02:34:12,160 --> 02:34:14,800
to work as one wills, meaning capital

4014
02:34:14,800 --> 02:34:16,960
will-"w" doesn't mean - go into the

4015
02:34:16,960 --> 02:34:18,479
pharmaceutical industry and sell

4016
02:34:18,479 --> 02:34:20,800
everybody poison, it doesn't mean go be a

4017
02:34:20,800 --> 02:34:22,319
cop and take people's rights when you're

4018
02:34:22,319 --> 02:34:26,560
ordered to and be a dumb order follower

4019
02:34:26,960 --> 02:34:29,840
it means align your work to the capital

4020
02:34:29,840 --> 02:34:32,640
"w" will of creation, and then

4021
02:34:32,640 --> 02:34:36,240
you'll be doing right livelihood and

4022
02:34:36,240 --> 02:34:38,640
that is in alignment with natural law

4023
02:34:38,640 --> 02:34:40,800
and the true will

4024
02:34:40,800 --> 02:34:44,000
same thing with the rest of them

4025
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,560
obviously we all need forms of

4026
02:34:46,560 --> 02:34:49,600
play entertainment to align

4027
02:34:49,600 --> 02:34:51,520
keep our body in homeostasis in

4028
02:34:51,520 --> 02:34:54,240
{equilibrium} that we don't lose it and go

4029
02:34:54,240 --> 02:34:56,479
into ill forms of health, same with rest

4030
02:34:56,479 --> 02:35:01,520
you have to balance work and rest

4031
02:35:01,520 --> 02:35:03,280
and everyone is sovereign over

4032
02:35:03,280 --> 02:35:06,240
their own body, we have bodily autonomy

4033
02:35:06,240 --> 02:35:08,000
we live in the way we will, we work the

4034
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
way we will, play and rest the way we all

4035
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,479
having to do with the self and the body

4036
02:35:12,479 --> 02:35:14,000
and then

4037
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:18,640
to die and end our lives as we see fit

4038
02:35:18,640 --> 02:35:19,920
this means

4039
02:35:19,920 --> 02:35:22,080
no one has the right to tell you

4040
02:35:22,080 --> 02:35:23,120
you know

4041
02:35:23,120 --> 02:35:24,880
what you can really do with your own

4042
02:35:24,880 --> 02:35:27,359
body, including if you're suffering and

4043
02:35:27,359 --> 02:35:29,120
you do want to end your life, that's

4044
02:35:29,120 --> 02:35:32,319
within your rights to do so

4045
02:35:32,319 --> 02:35:33,680
everybody has

4046
02:35:33,680 --> 02:35:35,760
full bodily autonomy and control over

4047
02:35:35,760 --> 02:35:37,439
what they're going to do with their body

4048
02:35:37,439 --> 02:35:38,800
i don't think it's a good decision to

4049
02:35:38,800 --> 02:35:40,720
start harming your body, but your body

4050
02:35:40,720 --> 02:35:42,960
belongs to you while your consciousness

4051
02:35:42,960 --> 02:35:44,720
inhabits it

4052
02:35:44,720 --> 02:35:47,200
nobody owns anything forever, we're not

4053
02:35:47,200 --> 02:35:50,640
talking about eternal ownership

4054
02:35:50,800 --> 02:35:52,960
your consciousness, your spirit

4055
02:35:52,960 --> 02:35:55,920
has possession of your body, it inhabits

4056
02:35:55,920 --> 02:35:57,520
and lives in the body while you're in

4057
02:35:57,520 --> 02:36:00,240
physicality, that means you own your body

4058
02:36:00,240 --> 02:36:02,080
and you have bodily autonomy to do as

4059
02:36:02,080 --> 02:36:05,880
you see fit with it

4060
02:36:10,960 --> 02:36:13,680
paragraph number two

4061
02:36:13,680 --> 02:36:16,160
man has the right to eat what he will, to

4062
02:36:16,160 --> 02:36:18,080
drink what he will, to dwell where he

4063
02:36:18,080 --> 02:36:20,399
will, to move as he will on the face of

4064
02:36:20,399 --> 02:36:22,319
the earth

4065
02:36:22,319 --> 02:36:24,880
these are the natural universal rights

4066
02:36:24,880 --> 02:36:26,240
to

4067
02:36:26,240 --> 02:36:28,720
use your body as you see fit, put into it

4068
02:36:28,720 --> 02:36:30,560
what you want

4069
02:36:30,560 --> 02:36:32,399
obviously

4070
02:36:32,399 --> 02:36:34,399
attempt to align that with the true will

4071
02:36:34,399 --> 02:36:36,880
again they're all capital "w"

4072
02:36:36,880 --> 02:36:38,479
meaning you start doing things that

4073
02:36:38,479 --> 02:36:40,080
break down the mind

4074
02:36:40,080 --> 02:36:41,840
pollute the body

4075
02:36:41,840 --> 02:36:44,880
don't lead to understanding

4076
02:36:44,880 --> 02:36:48,160
and you make those habitual

4077
02:36:48,160 --> 02:36:49,520
never saying don't eat a piece of

4078
02:36:49,520 --> 02:36:51,600
chocolate cake, never saying don't have a

4079
02:36:51,600 --> 02:36:54,399
beer, never saying, you know

4080
02:36:54,399 --> 02:36:56,560
don't do things that do bring you

4081
02:36:56,560 --> 02:36:59,359
physical pleasure

4082
02:36:59,359 --> 02:37:02,240
it's saying what you do most of the time

4083
02:37:02,240 --> 02:37:04,640
you're aligning that per to your higher

4084
02:37:04,640 --> 02:37:07,200
purpose to your true will

4085
02:37:07,200 --> 02:37:08,240
that means

4086
02:37:08,240 --> 02:37:10,080
yeah, don't become a drug addict, you're

4087
02:37:10,080 --> 02:37:11,840
not going to be doing the true will

4088
02:37:11,840 --> 02:37:14,319
don't, you know, become a total alcoholic

4089
02:37:14,319 --> 02:37:15,359
where you're ruining your health and

4090
02:37:15,359 --> 02:37:17,120
you're in and out of hospitals, that's

4091
02:37:17,120 --> 02:37:20,880
you're not aligning that with true will

4092
02:37:21,040 --> 02:37:22,479
that's not going to be conducive to

4093
02:37:22,479 --> 02:37:25,359
doing the true will

4094
02:37:26,080 --> 02:37:27,359
so

4095
02:37:27,359 --> 02:37:30,880
learn how to nourish the body properly

4096
02:37:30,880 --> 02:37:33,520
and take care of it

4097
02:37:33,520 --> 02:37:35,680
and, you know, to move as we will on the

4098
02:37:35,680 --> 02:37:37,920
face of the earth

4099
02:37:37,920 --> 02:37:41,200
travel is a human right

4100
02:37:41,280 --> 02:37:44,000
you know, the idea of constraining

4101
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:46,319
where people can and can't go through

4102
02:37:46,319 --> 02:37:49,040
invisible boundaries and borders is a

4103
02:37:49,040 --> 02:37:51,680
concept of statism

4104
02:37:51,680 --> 02:37:54,880
now, i get it flooding countries with

4105
02:37:54,880 --> 02:37:57,760
you know, immigrants that are not in that

4106
02:37:57,760 --> 02:38:00,399
cultural, you know

4107
02:38:00,399 --> 02:38:01,600
background

4108
02:38:01,600 --> 02:38:04,160
and trying to, you know, basically bring

4109
02:38:04,160 --> 02:38:06,479
the internal dynamics of the country

4110
02:38:06,479 --> 02:38:07,439
down

4111
02:38:07,439 --> 02:38:09,680
is a tactic, it's a part of the agenda

4112
02:38:09,680 --> 02:38:12,840
people do that, globalists do

4113
02:38:12,840 --> 02:38:16,399
that, but, again

4114
02:38:16,399 --> 02:38:18,880
all things being equal and governments

4115
02:38:18,880 --> 02:38:20,399
not

4116
02:38:20,399 --> 02:38:22,319
you know, artificially

4117
02:38:22,319 --> 02:38:24,160
creating these types of borders and

4118
02:38:24,160 --> 02:38:25,600
things like that, people have the right

4119
02:38:25,600 --> 02:38:29,120
to go wherever they want, you know

4120
02:38:29,120 --> 02:38:31,439
borders of countries are imaginary lines

4121
02:38:31,439 --> 02:38:32,960
as long as someone is not physically

4122
02:38:32,960 --> 02:38:35,600
hurting somebody, see, the problem is, it's

4123
02:38:35,600 --> 02:38:38,479
for a political agenda to hurt other

4124
02:38:38,479 --> 02:38:39,520
people

4125
02:38:39,520 --> 02:38:41,040
that's what

4126
02:38:41,040 --> 02:38:43,200
all of the forced immigration, that we see

4127
02:38:43,200 --> 02:38:46,240
in the world, is accomplishing and doing

4128
02:38:46,240 --> 02:38:49,040
they're bringing people in, who don't

4129
02:38:49,040 --> 02:38:52,000
align with the real values of

4130
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:55,520
the original intent of the country

4131
02:38:55,520 --> 02:38:57,760
and its traditions

4132
02:38:57,760 --> 02:38:58,800
and then

4133
02:38:58,800 --> 02:39:00,319
getting them to just

4134
02:39:00,319 --> 02:39:02,960
vote a certain way, so, that there's more

4135
02:39:02,960 --> 02:39:06,160
political power in a particular party

4136
02:39:06,160 --> 02:39:08,479
that's what all the artificial movement

4137
02:39:08,479 --> 02:39:10,319
of people around the globe are in the

4138
02:39:10,319 --> 02:39:11,840
form of

4139
02:39:11,840 --> 02:39:14,880
you know, refugees etc

4140
02:39:14,880 --> 02:39:17,600
and immigrants

4141
02:39:17,920 --> 02:39:19,359
i like

4142
02:39:19,359 --> 02:39:20,960
i can't remember his name, but there was

4143
02:39:20,960 --> 02:39:22,840
a gentleman who explained

4144
02:39:22,840 --> 02:39:25,520
immigration and trying to solve problems

4145
02:39:25,520 --> 02:39:27,920
by moving people around

4146
02:39:27,920 --> 02:39:30,640
with gumballs, and he showed

4147
02:39:30,640 --> 02:39:32,880
how much immigration happens

4148
02:39:32,880 --> 02:39:34,479
visually

4149
02:39:34,479 --> 02:39:37,439
with total percentage with total ratio

4150
02:39:37,439 --> 02:39:39,920
using gumballs in this video

4151
02:39:39,920 --> 02:39:41,600
and he showed

4152
02:39:41,600 --> 02:39:44,000
you're not helping people by doing that

4153
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:46,080
you're moving a tiny amount of people

4154
02:39:46,080 --> 02:39:48,720
people are best served where they are

4155
02:39:48,720 --> 02:39:50,080
if you want to help people, help them

4156
02:39:50,080 --> 02:39:51,600
where they already live, help them where

4157
02:39:51,600 --> 02:39:52,720
they are

4158
02:39:52,720 --> 02:39:54,720
uplift and raise consciousness, uplift

4159
02:39:54,720 --> 02:39:57,200
and raise that culture

4160
02:39:57,200 --> 02:39:59,439
not all cultures are the same, all human

4161
02:39:59,439 --> 02:40:02,000
rights are the same, not all cultures are

4162
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:03,280
equal

4163
02:40:03,280 --> 02:40:06,000
some are fallen, just like not all

4164
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:08,399
religious traditions are equal, some are

4165
02:40:08,399 --> 02:40:10,720
more fallen than others, not all occult

4166
02:40:10,720 --> 02:40:12,640
traditions are equal, some are more

4167
02:40:12,640 --> 02:40:14,399
fallen than others

4168
02:40:14,399 --> 02:40:16,000
you know, we can't equate everything, we

4169
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:19,279
can't say everything is equal, it's not

4170
02:40:19,279 --> 02:40:21,279
human rights are equal

4171
02:40:21,279 --> 02:40:23,920
that's total equality

4172
02:40:23,920 --> 02:40:25,920
that is sameness

4173
02:40:25,920 --> 02:40:28,479
everybody has the same rights everywhere

4174
02:40:28,479 --> 02:40:30,479
they want to make sameness in

4175
02:40:30,479 --> 02:40:32,080
individuality

4176
02:40:32,080 --> 02:40:33,680
for each individual they want them the

4177
02:40:33,680 --> 02:40:34,560
same

4178
02:40:34,560 --> 02:40:36,399
they want them in the same layer of

4179
02:40:36,399 --> 02:40:37,760
mediocrity

4180
02:40:37,760 --> 02:40:39,520
they want cultures all to be the same

4181
02:40:39,520 --> 02:40:41,040
all governed by

4182
02:40:41,040 --> 02:40:44,160
satanic globalists - i apologize for

4183
02:40:44,160 --> 02:40:46,160
the noise outside, i don't have control

4184
02:40:46,160 --> 02:40:49,200
over a truck backing up, folks, so

4185
02:40:49,200 --> 02:40:51,120
we'll just have to deal with it and work

4186
02:40:51,120 --> 02:40:53,520
through it

4187
02:40:55,200 --> 02:40:56,800
but i just want to say, i believe in

4188
02:40:56,800 --> 02:40:58,960
individual right to travel, to move as we

4189
02:40:58,960 --> 02:41:03,080
will on the face of this planet

4190
02:41:04,399 --> 02:41:06,960
paragraph number three

4191
02:41:06,960 --> 02:41:09,760
man has the right to think what he will

4192
02:41:09,760 --> 02:41:12,319
autonomy in mind, of course

4193
02:41:12,319 --> 02:41:14,720
to speak what he will, to write what he

4194
02:41:14,720 --> 02:41:19,279
will, to draw, paint, carve, etch, mold, build

4195
02:41:19,279 --> 02:41:21,840
as he will, to dress as he will, this is

4196
02:41:21,840 --> 02:41:23,920
all the individual creative aspects of

4197
02:41:23,920 --> 02:41:26,240
the being, that no one has the right to

4198
02:41:26,240 --> 02:41:28,479
take away

4199
02:41:28,479 --> 02:41:30,960
and we want to set up a million laws and

4200
02:41:30,960 --> 02:41:34,000
restrictions, see, that's all

4201
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:36,640
evil ultimately is

4202
02:41:36,640 --> 02:41:39,600
evil is continuous restriction upon

4203
02:41:39,600 --> 02:41:41,600
human freedom and rights

4204
02:41:41,600 --> 02:41:44,319
that's evil, and if you're for that

4205
02:41:44,319 --> 02:41:46,560
you're serving the force of evil, you're

4206
02:41:46,560 --> 02:41:48,319
serving the very essence of evil, the

4207
02:41:48,319 --> 02:41:50,560
heart of evil

4208
02:41:50,560 --> 02:41:53,760
that is what the involutionary force

4209
02:41:53,760 --> 02:41:56,640
satan, shatan in the hebrew

4210
02:41:56,640 --> 02:41:58,240
tradition

4211
02:41:58,240 --> 02:42:01,120
the adversary, the opposer, the force of

4212
02:42:01,120 --> 02:42:03,120
evil that wants to destroy humanity and

4213
02:42:03,120 --> 02:42:05,680
destroy human consciousness, is always

4214
02:42:05,680 --> 02:42:08,319
working to do to create more and more

4215
02:42:08,319 --> 02:42:11,040
justifications through fear, to continue

4216
02:42:11,040 --> 02:42:14,240
to constrain rights, more and more, and

4217
02:42:14,240 --> 02:42:15,359
more

4218
02:42:15,359 --> 02:42:18,720
and that is the great deception of satan

4219
02:42:18,720 --> 02:42:20,160
it's a force

4220
02:42:20,160 --> 02:42:22,560
it's not, i don't look at it as an entity

4221
02:42:22,560 --> 02:42:26,960
like they do in the christian tradition

4222
02:42:26,960 --> 02:42:29,120
you know, this was

4223
02:42:29,120 --> 02:42:30,960
apollyon

4224
02:42:30,960 --> 02:42:33,439
the concept of apollyon in the greek

4225
02:42:33,439 --> 02:42:36,640
tradition, not apollo - apollyon

4226
02:42:36,640 --> 02:42:37,680
you know

4227
02:42:37,680 --> 02:42:40,880
this was

4228
02:42:40,880 --> 02:42:43,760
in the egyptian tradition, this was

4229
02:42:43,760 --> 02:42:45,520
apophis

4230
02:42:45,520 --> 02:42:48,000
right, it was called satan in the hebrew

4231
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:49,600
tradition and then in the christian

4232
02:42:49,600 --> 02:42:50,800
tradition

4233
02:42:50,800 --> 02:42:53,760
this is apophis, the destroyer

4234
02:42:53,760 --> 02:42:56,720
the adversary of humanity, the adversary

4235
02:42:56,720 --> 02:43:00,240
of the light, the adversary of amen ra

4236
02:43:00,240 --> 02:43:02,960
in the egyptian tradition

4237
02:43:02,960 --> 02:43:04,479
this is seth

4238
02:43:04,479 --> 02:43:05,840
in the

4239
02:43:05,840 --> 02:43:08,800
later egyptian tradition

4240
02:43:08,800 --> 02:43:10,960
who conquers horus and puts him into

4241
02:43:10,960 --> 02:43:12,960
the underworld, where they do battle and

4242
02:43:12,960 --> 02:43:14,960
horus eventually has to conquer the

4243
02:43:14,960 --> 02:43:17,680
negative influence of seth and rise back

4244
02:43:17,680 --> 02:43:20,840
on the horus zone, the horizon in the

4245
02:43:20,840 --> 02:43:23,680
morning, again, representing the battle

4246
02:43:23,680 --> 02:43:25,279
between light and darkness, the battle

4247
02:43:25,279 --> 02:43:27,840
between good and evil, the battle between

4248
02:43:27,840 --> 02:43:31,279
freedom and the restriction of freedom

4249
02:43:31,279 --> 02:43:33,920
that is what all the dark archetypal

4250
02:43:33,920 --> 02:43:37,200
gods throughout history represented

4251
02:43:37,200 --> 02:43:40,319
to restrict freedom is to perform evil

4252
02:43:40,319 --> 02:43:42,880
you don't have that right

4253
02:43:42,880 --> 02:43:45,600
everybody has the natural right to live

4254
02:43:45,600 --> 02:43:47,760
according to their natural rights

4255
02:43:47,760 --> 02:43:49,680
and when one restricts that - that is

4256
02:43:49,680 --> 02:43:50,880
coercion

4257
02:43:50,880 --> 02:43:53,120
when one restricts that - that is duress

4258
02:43:53,120 --> 02:43:55,600
and when physically restricts it - that is

4259
02:43:55,600 --> 02:43:58,080
violence

4260
02:43:58,560 --> 02:44:00,000
paragraph

4261
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:01,600
number four

4262
02:44:01,600 --> 02:44:03,359
so, again, this third paragraph is all

4263
02:44:03,359 --> 02:44:07,359
about the creative rights of humankind

4264
02:44:07,359 --> 02:44:10,640
of humanity, of people

4265
02:44:10,640 --> 02:44:11,680
we can

4266
02:44:11,680 --> 02:44:13,920
exercise the creative expressions that

4267
02:44:13,920 --> 02:44:16,399
we want to use to bring about the great

4268
02:44:16,399 --> 02:44:18,560
work, to bring about the true will, and in

4269
02:44:18,560 --> 02:44:20,560
other ways

4270
02:44:20,560 --> 02:44:22,800
nobody can stop us, nobody should have

4271
02:44:22,800 --> 02:44:24,960
the power or the right to stop us from

4272
02:44:24,960 --> 02:44:27,200
those types of creative expressions that

4273
02:44:27,200 --> 02:44:29,520
are explained there in paragraph three

4274
02:44:29,520 --> 02:44:31,040
of liber oz

4275
02:44:31,040 --> 02:44:32,800
paragraph four

4276
02:44:32,800 --> 02:44:35,520
man has the right to love as he will

4277
02:44:35,520 --> 02:44:38,640
this means, if there is consensual

4278
02:44:38,640 --> 02:44:40,640
sexuality

4279
02:44:40,640 --> 02:44:42,640
it is a human right

4280
02:44:42,640 --> 02:44:44,800
stop trying to constrain other people's

4281
02:44:44,800 --> 02:44:47,359
sexuality, as long as they are not

4282
02:44:47,359 --> 02:44:49,520
harming anybody and the acts are of

4283
02:44:49,520 --> 02:44:53,600
mutual consent with consenting adults

4284
02:44:53,600 --> 02:44:56,240
sexuality should be unrestrained and

4285
02:44:56,240 --> 02:44:58,160
should be nobody's business except the

4286
02:44:58,160 --> 02:45:01,120
people who are involved in

4287
02:45:01,120 --> 02:45:05,120
the mutual consensual acts

4288
02:45:05,120 --> 02:45:07,040
this is why religion

4289
02:45:07,040 --> 02:45:09,200
has their head up their ass when it

4290
02:45:09,200 --> 02:45:10,479
comes to

4291
02:45:10,479 --> 02:45:13,680
what they think sexuality should be

4292
02:45:13,680 --> 02:45:15,600
it's none of their business

4293
02:45:15,600 --> 02:45:18,560
this is ridiculous notions of things

4294
02:45:18,560 --> 02:45:21,920
that have no bearing on morality unless

4295
02:45:21,920 --> 02:45:25,120
rape comes into play, or sexual abuse of

4296
02:45:25,120 --> 02:45:27,359
children comes into play, because they're

4297
02:45:27,359 --> 02:45:30,240
too young to make the informed decision

4298
02:45:30,240 --> 02:45:32,319
to consent to a sexual act, that's why

4299
02:45:32,319 --> 02:45:34,800
you don't involve children in sexuality

4300
02:45:34,800 --> 02:45:38,000
they're still developing, they're still

4301
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:40,399
learning about what their sexuality or

4302
02:45:40,399 --> 02:45:42,399
their sexual orientation is going to be

4303
02:45:42,399 --> 02:45:44,399
their sexual likes and dislikes, and

4304
02:45:44,399 --> 02:45:47,920
preferences etc

4305
02:45:48,720 --> 02:45:51,439
obviously, a certain amount of education

4306
02:45:51,439 --> 02:45:52,960
should be involved in that, when the

4307
02:45:52,960 --> 02:45:55,600
child is of age coming into puberty and

4308
02:45:55,600 --> 02:45:57,439
beginning to understand having the

4309
02:45:57,439 --> 02:45:59,279
capability of understanding those things

4310
02:45:59,279 --> 02:46:00,560
but it shouldn't be

4311
02:46:00,560 --> 02:46:04,240
foisted onto very young children

4312
02:46:04,240 --> 02:46:07,600
and that's a big agenda today

4313
02:46:07,600 --> 02:46:11,200
swerving and moving, shuffling around and

4314
02:46:11,200 --> 02:46:13,439
creating this whole idea of fluidity

4315
02:46:13,439 --> 02:46:16,160
with so-called gender, i think that's

4316
02:46:16,160 --> 02:46:18,080
messing around with children

4317
02:46:18,080 --> 02:46:20,160
i'm not saying that people are not free

4318
02:46:20,160 --> 02:46:21,760
to choose their own

4319
02:46:21,760 --> 02:46:23,120
whatever

4320
02:46:23,120 --> 02:46:24,399
orientation

4321
02:46:24,399 --> 02:46:25,200
they

4322
02:46:25,200 --> 02:46:26,720
wish to choose for themselves, that's

4323
02:46:26,720 --> 02:46:28,399
their own right and their own free will

4324
02:46:28,399 --> 02:46:30,720
what i'm saying is - you begin

4325
02:46:30,720 --> 02:46:33,200
attempting to foist that on the children

4326
02:46:33,200 --> 02:46:35,279
it creates a lot of internal confusion

4327
02:46:35,279 --> 02:46:37,200
within them, and a lot of people will

4328
02:46:37,200 --> 02:46:39,439
take exception of this - go right ahead

4329
02:46:39,439 --> 02:46:41,600
the bottom line with it is

4330
02:46:41,600 --> 02:46:44,000
let the child develop naturally

4331
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:46,720
and make their own informed decisions by

4332
02:46:46,720 --> 02:46:48,720
giving them certain

4333
02:46:48,720 --> 02:46:50,640
base information, when they're old enough

4334
02:46:50,640 --> 02:46:53,920
to understand - this is common sense, folks

4335
02:46:53,920 --> 02:46:56,319
there's nothing radical being said there

4336
02:46:56,319 --> 02:47:00,080
that's very, a very common sense, normal

4337
02:47:00,080 --> 02:47:02,880
natural approach to human sexuality and

4338
02:47:02,880 --> 02:47:05,040
teaching it to children

4339
02:47:05,040 --> 02:47:06,640
and that's how parents have basically

4340
02:47:06,640 --> 02:47:09,760
done it for aeons, and now there is an

4341
02:47:09,760 --> 02:47:12,080
agenda to try to twist that all up, get

4342
02:47:12,080 --> 02:47:14,000
people very confused, and

4343
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:16,479
people confused about

4344
02:47:16,479 --> 02:47:19,279
identity and sexuality can become

4345
02:47:19,279 --> 02:47:22,640
part of a overarching wider agenda to

4346
02:47:22,640 --> 02:47:24,319
damage other people

4347
02:47:24,319 --> 02:47:27,279
and even to normalize things like

4348
02:47:27,279 --> 02:47:28,800
pedophilia

4349
02:47:28,800 --> 02:47:29,600
which

4350
02:47:29,600 --> 02:47:32,479
is another big part of the agenda

4351
02:47:32,479 --> 02:47:34,800
that they want when it comes to sex

4352
02:47:34,800 --> 02:47:37,040
but

4353
02:47:37,120 --> 02:47:39,359
this paragraph, that's the end of the

4354
02:47:39,359 --> 02:47:42,000
paragraph, proper there is another quote

4355
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:43,439
underneath it

4356
02:47:43,439 --> 02:47:46,160
but  the paragraph is simply one line

4357
02:47:46,160 --> 02:47:48,319
man has the right to love as he will

4358
02:47:48,319 --> 02:47:51,760
very simple, very common sense

4359
02:47:51,760 --> 02:47:54,000
if it's consensual and mutual - it's

4360
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:56,319
voluntary - it's a right

4361
02:47:56,319 --> 02:47:57,680
don't get involved in other people's

4362
02:47:57,680 --> 02:48:00,000
sexuality, but don't push

4363
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:02,319
agendas of sexuality onto very young

4364
02:48:02,319 --> 02:48:03,359
children

4365
02:48:03,359 --> 02:48:05,439
leave them alone, let them

4366
02:48:05,439 --> 02:48:07,040
come through the formative years

4367
02:48:07,040 --> 02:48:09,439
naturally, and when they hit

4368
02:48:09,439 --> 02:48:11,439
early puberty you could start having

4369
02:48:11,439 --> 02:48:13,040
that discussion with them, which is when

4370
02:48:13,040 --> 02:48:15,520
it's very appropriate and natural to do

4371
02:48:15,520 --> 02:48:17,600
obviously, young children could have

4372
02:48:17,600 --> 02:48:20,080
questions - you explain it in a simplified

4373
02:48:20,080 --> 02:48:20,880
way

4374
02:48:20,880 --> 02:48:23,120
but you don't want to overly sexualize

4375
02:48:23,120 --> 02:48:26,399
young children, it's very common sense

4376
02:48:26,399 --> 02:48:28,560
and no one should be hearing that as

4377
02:48:28,560 --> 02:48:30,399
you know, speaking out about

4378
02:48:30,399 --> 02:48:33,439
against anyone's right to self-identity

4379
02:48:33,439 --> 02:48:35,520
or sexual orientation

4380
02:48:35,520 --> 02:48:37,439
that's obviously your natural right to

4381
02:48:37,439 --> 02:48:39,439
do that

4382
02:48:39,439 --> 02:48:41,359
children do have to be protected to a

4383
02:48:41,359 --> 02:48:43,600
certain extent when it comes to

4384
02:48:43,600 --> 02:48:46,080
learning about human sexuality until

4385
02:48:46,080 --> 02:48:47,439
they're old enough to take that

4386
02:48:47,439 --> 02:48:50,399
responsibility on, in a healthy way

4387
02:48:50,399 --> 02:48:52,080
because if it's done too quickly or

4388
02:48:52,080 --> 02:48:55,200
abruptly, or according to an agenda, it

4389
02:48:55,200 --> 02:48:57,200
can create psychological problems and

4390
02:48:57,200 --> 02:48:59,120
trauma for the child, which we

4391
02:48:59,120 --> 02:49:00,880
want to avoid

4392
02:49:00,880 --> 02:49:03,600
doing that to young children

4393
02:49:03,600 --> 02:49:05,279
so, i think i've explained my position

4394
02:49:05,279 --> 02:49:07,279
quite clearly on that and that's that

4395
02:49:07,279 --> 02:49:09,439
paragraph, now, let's look at the quote

4396
02:49:09,439 --> 02:49:12,000
underneath, it says - take your fill of

4397
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:13,279
love

4398
02:49:13,279 --> 02:49:16,720
fill and will of love as ye will when

4399
02:49:16,720 --> 02:49:19,840
where and with whom ye will - this means

4400
02:49:19,840 --> 02:49:22,160
the restriction upon love and

4401
02:49:22,160 --> 02:49:26,240
sexuality by religions, by political

4402
02:49:26,240 --> 02:49:27,760
forces

4403
02:49:27,760 --> 02:49:29,120
is not

4404
02:49:29,120 --> 02:49:31,760
right and should not be done

4405
02:49:31,760 --> 02:49:34,000
we have the right to express

4406
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:35,920
our feelings for other people

4407
02:49:35,920 --> 02:49:39,120
as we choose, so long as the acts

4408
02:49:39,120 --> 02:49:42,399
are voluntary and consensual, and mutual

4409
02:49:42,399 --> 02:49:44,800
between all parties involved, not that

4410
02:49:44,800 --> 02:49:46,960
hard to understand, and this is what

4411
02:49:46,960 --> 02:49:50,479
those quotes actually mean

4412
02:49:50,479 --> 02:49:51,600
and now

4413
02:49:51,600 --> 02:49:53,359
of course, dealing with a damn drill

4414
02:49:53,359 --> 02:49:54,640
outside

4415
02:49:54,640 --> 02:49:57,439
in the tight quarters of south

4416
02:49:57,439 --> 02:49:58,960
philadelphia

4417
02:49:58,960 --> 02:50:00,960
i have to attempt to explain the most

4418
02:50:00,960 --> 02:50:03,439
important part of liber oz

4419
02:50:03,439 --> 02:50:04,960
and get around

4420
02:50:04,960 --> 02:50:08,319
the distraction, which, of course, has

4421
02:50:08,319 --> 02:50:11,600
to be there, on a sunday afternoon of all

4422
02:50:11,600 --> 02:50:13,520
times, they can't take the break on a

4423
02:50:13,520 --> 02:50:16,000
sunday, because i'm doing my show, you

4424
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:17,520
know, so

4425
02:50:17,520 --> 02:50:19,439
not saying that's necessarily deliberate

4426
02:50:19,439 --> 02:50:20,625
but

4427
02:50:21,799 --> 02:50:23,840
let's power through it

4428
02:50:23,840 --> 02:50:25,840
if i have to raise my voice a little, so

4429
02:50:25,840 --> 02:50:27,200
be it

4430
02:50:27,200 --> 02:50:29,279
paragraph number five

4431
02:50:29,279 --> 02:50:31,840
the be-all and end-all of liber oz, the

4432
02:50:31,840 --> 02:50:34,240
part that puts it all together

4433
02:50:34,240 --> 02:50:37,920
man has the right to kill those who

4434
02:50:37,920 --> 02:50:40,479
would thwart these rights

4435
02:50:40,479 --> 02:50:42,479
now, let's read that again

4436
02:50:42,479 --> 02:50:44,160
and look at the simplicity of the

4437
02:50:44,160 --> 02:50:46,640
statement, but look at the qualification

4438
02:50:46,640 --> 02:50:48,800
of the statement

4439
02:50:48,800 --> 02:50:52,080
man has the right, capital "r", natural

4440
02:50:52,080 --> 02:50:56,000
right to kill, not murder - to kill

4441
02:50:56,000 --> 02:50:59,840
to end the aggression, the initiation of

4442
02:50:59,840 --> 02:51:01,600
violent aggression

4443
02:51:01,600 --> 02:51:03,840
the word kill, which is what that means

4444
02:51:03,840 --> 02:51:05,680
in that context

4445
02:51:05,680 --> 02:51:09,279
those who would thwart these rights

4446
02:51:09,279 --> 02:51:12,240
it doesn't even say, it's such a

4447
02:51:12,240 --> 02:51:15,279
radical statement about the right

4448
02:51:15,279 --> 02:51:16,800
existing

4449
02:51:16,800 --> 02:51:19,200
to kill those who would thwart these

4450
02:51:19,200 --> 02:51:22,960
rights that, notice the statement is not

4451
02:51:22,960 --> 02:51:26,319
man has the right to kill those who are

4452
02:51:26,319 --> 02:51:28,479
thwarting his rights

4453
02:51:28,479 --> 02:51:30,160
presently

4454
02:51:30,160 --> 02:51:32,160
it doesn't even say that, it's more

4455
02:51:32,160 --> 02:51:35,040
extreme than that

4456
02:51:35,040 --> 02:51:38,080
it says - man has the right to kill those

4457
02:51:38,080 --> 02:51:41,680
who would thwart these rights

4458
02:51:41,680 --> 02:51:42,640
meaning

4459
02:51:42,640 --> 02:51:46,080
if they even express the idea

4460
02:51:46,080 --> 02:51:48,640
that they want to curtail other people's

4461
02:51:48,640 --> 02:51:51,200
rights in these regards

4462
02:51:51,200 --> 02:51:53,040
and in really any other regard that man

4463
02:51:53,040 --> 02:51:54,800
has the natural right to do something to

4464
02:51:54,800 --> 02:51:56,880
engage in a behavior, and other people

4465
02:51:56,880 --> 02:51:59,279
say - i think that should be put down and

4466
02:51:59,279 --> 02:52:01,600
stopped

4467
02:52:01,600 --> 02:52:03,600
and i would have people come with

4468
02:52:03,600 --> 02:52:06,800
violence to do that

4469
02:52:07,359 --> 02:52:10,560
you've already opened up the right to be

4470
02:52:10,560 --> 02:52:13,200
taken out of existence, you've already

4471
02:52:13,200 --> 02:52:15,520
forfeited your own right to live

4472
02:52:15,520 --> 02:52:17,680
and i fully agree

4473
02:52:17,680 --> 02:52:19,760
i fully agree with it with that

4474
02:52:19,760 --> 02:52:22,240
statement

4475
02:52:23,200 --> 02:52:26,080
leave other people alone

4476
02:52:26,080 --> 02:52:29,359
stop fucking with other people's rights

4477
02:52:29,359 --> 02:52:31,040
you don't have the right to do it

4478
02:52:31,040 --> 02:52:32,399
motherfucker

4479
02:52:32,399 --> 02:52:34,800
that's all comes down to

4480
02:52:34,800 --> 02:52:37,520
and if you do do it - you forfeit your own

4481
02:52:37,520 --> 02:52:39,200
life

4482
02:52:39,200 --> 02:52:42,760
you've forfeit your life

4483
02:52:42,760 --> 02:52:45,760
instantaneously in the snap of fingers

4484
02:52:45,760 --> 02:52:47,840
and the person who you're doing that to

4485
02:52:47,840 --> 02:52:50,880
has a right to end you

4486
02:52:50,880 --> 02:52:52,479
and again, i'm not

4487
02:52:52,479 --> 02:52:53,439
saying

4488
02:52:53,439 --> 02:52:56,319
for them to immediately do that, i'm

4489
02:52:56,319 --> 02:53:00,319
saying that the right exists in nature

4490
02:53:00,319 --> 02:53:02,880
at the time we are living in

4491
02:53:02,880 --> 02:53:04,240
it may be

4492
02:53:04,240 --> 02:53:05,680
a very

4493
02:53:05,680 --> 02:53:09,040
bad idea to exercise that right

4494
02:53:09,040 --> 02:53:10,880
immediately

4495
02:53:10,880 --> 02:53:13,439
but it exists

4496
02:53:13,439 --> 02:53:16,560
no question of its existence

4497
02:53:16,560 --> 02:53:18,560
and what crowley is writing here in

4498
02:53:18,560 --> 02:53:20,640
liber oz, is that

4499
02:53:20,640 --> 02:53:24,880
the right exists even before the action

4500
02:53:24,880 --> 02:53:26,479
is taken

4501
02:53:26,479 --> 02:53:30,240
physically to destroy other's rights

4502
02:53:30,240 --> 02:53:33,439
to kill the people who would agree to do

4503
02:53:33,439 --> 02:53:36,960
it, meaning, if in the mental domain you

4504
02:53:36,960 --> 02:53:39,840
are just stating your intent

4505
02:53:39,840 --> 02:53:41,600
that you would be the usurper and

4506
02:53:41,600 --> 02:53:44,560
destroyer of a natural right of humanity

4507
02:53:44,560 --> 02:53:46,880
you deserve to die

4508
02:53:46,880 --> 02:53:48,880
you deserve to die

4509
02:53:48,880 --> 02:53:50,640
and that other people have a right to

4510
02:53:50,640 --> 02:53:53,439
end your physical existence merely for

4511
02:53:53,439 --> 02:53:56,640
the fact that you believe that bullshit

4512
02:53:56,640 --> 02:53:59,200
in your own mind

4513
02:53:59,200 --> 02:54:01,040
that you would not even have to take

4514
02:54:01,040 --> 02:54:02,240
that action

4515
02:54:02,240 --> 02:54:05,760
but by simply expressing it

4516
02:54:05,760 --> 02:54:07,760
you forfeit your life

4517
02:54:07,760 --> 02:54:10,880
and it's null and void

4518
02:54:10,880 --> 02:54:13,600
until you revoke that statement and say

4519
02:54:13,600 --> 02:54:15,439
i no longer think that, and i was wrong

4520
02:54:15,439 --> 02:54:17,439
for ever thinking it

4521
02:54:17,439 --> 02:54:20,560
and i absolutely agree and, guess what

4522
02:54:20,560 --> 02:54:22,479
that's going to be a hard bitter fucking

4523
02:54:22,479 --> 02:54:24,720
pill to swallow for most jackasses out

4524
02:54:24,720 --> 02:54:27,279
there, and go ahead, have as difficult of

4525
02:54:27,279 --> 02:54:29,520
a time swallowing it as you want

4526
02:54:29,520 --> 02:54:31,840
say you disagree, say

4527
02:54:31,840 --> 02:54:33,840
i don't know what i'm talking about, it's

4528
02:54:33,840 --> 02:54:36,479
still true, it's still the truth

4529
02:54:36,479 --> 02:54:37,920
and, guess what

4530
02:54:37,920 --> 02:54:39,520
that's the highest expression of

4531
02:54:39,520 --> 02:54:41,520
spirituality that exists, believe it or

4532
02:54:41,520 --> 02:54:42,240
not

4533
02:54:42,240 --> 02:54:45,840
this statement is all you really need to

4534
02:54:45,840 --> 02:54:48,399
understand, and i know, i'm gonna alienate

4535
02:54:48,399 --> 02:54:50,000
people, guess what

4536
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:51,600
who gives a fuck

4537
02:54:51,600 --> 02:54:53,520
it's still true - turn it off, turn the

4538
02:54:53,520 --> 02:54:55,680
show off - go, go watch and listen to

4539
02:54:55,680 --> 02:54:57,120
something else, go, go, put the fucking

4540
02:54:57,120 --> 02:54:58,880
football game on, who gives a fuck what

4541
02:54:58,880 --> 02:55:00,880
you do ?

4542
02:55:00,880 --> 02:55:03,359
i'm here for the strong

4543
02:55:03,359 --> 02:55:05,920
i'm not here for the dross

4544
02:55:05,920 --> 02:55:07,760
fuck the dross

4545
02:55:07,760 --> 02:55:09,840
this is the law of the strong and the

4546
02:55:09,840 --> 02:55:12,240
joy of the world

4547
02:55:12,240 --> 02:55:13,600
okay

4548
02:55:13,600 --> 02:55:15,760
this is the actual good news, because

4549
02:55:15,760 --> 02:55:19,120
it's the truth, it's real, it's true, it's

4550
02:55:19,120 --> 02:55:21,920
nature's law, it's the law of nature and

4551
02:55:21,920 --> 02:55:24,319
it's natural law

4552
02:55:24,319 --> 02:55:26,160
this is the law of the creator of the

4553
02:55:26,160 --> 02:55:27,520
universe that they don't want you to

4554
02:55:27,520 --> 02:55:28,880
understand

4555
02:55:28,880 --> 02:55:31,439
your rights don't come from man

4556
02:55:31,439 --> 02:55:33,680
when man steals them he's forfeit his

4557
02:55:33,680 --> 02:55:34,800
own

4558
02:55:34,800 --> 02:55:37,359
that's it

4559
02:55:37,840 --> 02:55:40,080
your rights don't come from mankind, they

4560
02:55:40,080 --> 02:55:42,399
come from the creator of the universe

4561
02:55:42,399 --> 02:55:44,479
once somebody tries to steal your rights

4562
02:55:44,479 --> 02:55:46,399
they forfeit their life

4563
02:55:46,399 --> 02:55:48,640
that's the bottom fucking line of all of

4564
02:55:48,640 --> 02:55:49,520
it

4565
02:55:49,520 --> 02:55:51,120
that's what we're here on this earth to

4566
02:55:51,120 --> 02:55:52,399
learn

4567
02:55:52,399 --> 02:55:56,319
that's the ultimate expression of truth

4568
02:55:56,319 --> 02:55:59,200
and spirituality ever written by

4569
02:55:59,200 --> 02:56:00,720
man

4570
02:56:00,720 --> 02:56:03,760
ever penned in one sentence

4571
02:56:03,760 --> 02:56:05,439
it's all you need to know, you remember

4572
02:56:05,439 --> 02:56:06,800
the i don't know if anything about - i'm a

4573
02:56:06,800 --> 02:56:08,880
pro wrestling fan, i'll inject some humor

4574
02:56:08,880 --> 02:56:11,040
here, some people know that, some

4575
02:56:11,040 --> 02:56:13,040
people would find that humorous, but i've

4576
02:56:13,040 --> 02:56:14,640
been a wrestling fan since i was five

4577
02:56:14,640 --> 02:56:16,880
years old, and i still, you know

4578
02:56:16,880 --> 02:56:19,520
occasionally watching, i still generally

4579
02:56:19,520 --> 02:56:20,880
follow it and

4580
02:56:20,880 --> 02:56:23,760
go to matches sometimes, however, there's

4581
02:56:23,760 --> 02:56:26,160
an old wrestler named Baron von Raschke

4582
02:56:26,160 --> 02:56:27,040
you know

4583
02:56:27,040 --> 02:56:29,279
i guess, german or austrian, his big

4584
02:56:29,279 --> 02:56:31,439
move was the claw, right, he'd put his

4585
02:56:31,439 --> 02:56:33,200
hand out like that, he'd grab onto

4586
02:56:33,200 --> 02:56:34,720
somebody's head and face press their

4587
02:56:34,720 --> 02:56:36,960
temples, make them tap out, make

4588
02:56:36,960 --> 02:56:38,080
them submit

4589
02:56:38,080 --> 02:56:39,439
from the pressure he's putting on their

4590
02:56:39,439 --> 02:56:41,840
skull with his hand, you know, his hand

4591
02:56:41,840 --> 02:56:43,600
said, he had like a vice grip with his

4592
02:56:43,600 --> 02:56:44,720
hand

4593
02:56:44,720 --> 02:56:46,240
and he would go like this and he'd say

4594
02:56:46,240 --> 02:56:48,160
the claw is all the people need to know

4595
02:56:48,160 --> 02:56:50,960
the claw is all the people need to know

4596
02:56:50,960 --> 02:56:52,319
liber oz

4597
02:56:52,319 --> 02:56:54,960
is all the people need to know

4598
02:56:54,960 --> 02:56:56,880
that's it, in the words of Baron von

4599
02:56:56,880 --> 02:57:00,319
Raschke - liber oz is all the people need

4600
02:57:00,319 --> 02:57:02,399
to know - one time

4601
02:57:02,399 --> 02:57:04,880
one time, i did, i put a meme out on

4602
02:57:04,880 --> 02:57:07,040
social media, i had an old image of Baron

4603
02:57:07,040 --> 02:57:09,600
von Raschke doing his "the claws all the

4604
02:57:09,600 --> 02:57:11,120
people need to know" thing, he'd go like

4605
02:57:11,120 --> 02:57:14,240
that, and i put liber oz in it, and i

4606
02:57:14,240 --> 02:57:16,800
wrote as the caption - "liber oz is all the

4607
02:57:16,800 --> 02:57:18,720
people need to know"

4608
02:57:18,720 --> 02:57:20,479
i thought it was pretty funny, people

4609
02:57:20,479 --> 02:57:22,080
would have to be an old wrestling fan to

4610
02:57:22,080 --> 02:57:23,840
understand it from way back

4611
02:57:23,840 --> 02:57:26,720
to even know von Raschke, but

4612
02:57:26,720 --> 02:57:28,720
my point is

4613
02:57:28,720 --> 02:57:30,800
this is actually the be-all and end-all

4614
02:57:30,800 --> 02:57:34,240
of spiritual expression

4615
02:57:34,240 --> 02:57:36,960
and if you really understand it

4616
02:57:36,960 --> 02:57:41,120
it does truly equate to actual spiritual

4617
02:57:41,120 --> 02:57:42,960
enlightenment and the understanding of

4618
02:57:42,960 --> 02:57:44,399
natural law

4619
02:57:44,399 --> 02:57:46,160
that's why so many people have a hard

4620
02:57:46,160 --> 02:57:47,680
time with it, because they don't

4621
02:57:47,680 --> 02:57:49,840
understand natural law, they don't

4622
02:57:49,840 --> 02:57:52,240
understand the rights of man

4623
02:57:52,240 --> 02:57:54,560
meaning, humanity, mankind

4624
02:57:54,560 --> 02:57:56,960
obviously, not gender men

4625
02:57:56,960 --> 02:57:58,160
okay

4626
02:57:58,160 --> 02:58:00,080
when i say man i'm talking about capital

4627
02:58:00,080 --> 02:58:02,240
"m"-man like at the top of this document

4628
02:58:02,240 --> 02:58:06,160
mankind, humanity, all human beings

4629
02:58:06,160 --> 02:58:07,680
as soon as someone attacks the

4630
02:58:07,680 --> 02:58:10,160
sovereignty of another soul

4631
02:58:10,160 --> 02:58:13,600
their life is forfeit, until they reject

4632
02:58:13,600 --> 02:58:15,439
that position

4633
02:58:15,439 --> 02:58:17,120
then they could be taken back into the

4634
02:58:17,120 --> 02:58:19,439
human fold and treated with their rights

4635
02:58:19,439 --> 02:58:21,200
intact

4636
02:58:21,200 --> 02:58:22,560
but if someone

4637
02:58:22,560 --> 02:58:24,160
even expresses

4638
02:58:24,160 --> 02:58:26,000
i want to curtail the rights of other

4639
02:58:26,000 --> 02:58:27,680
sovereign beings

4640
02:58:27,680 --> 02:58:29,920
as far as the universe is concerned

4641
02:58:29,920 --> 02:58:33,040
that's an actionable

4642
02:58:33,040 --> 02:58:35,279
expressed thought -  those are

4643
02:58:35,279 --> 02:58:37,600
fighting words, that's not protected

4644
02:58:37,600 --> 02:58:39,359
speech and thought at that idea, that's

4645
02:58:39,359 --> 02:58:40,880
why i've always said

4646
02:58:40,880 --> 02:58:42,880
i'm not a total

4647
02:58:42,880 --> 02:58:45,120
speech absolutist, i'm totally for free

4648
02:58:45,120 --> 02:58:47,120
speech, but as soon as you start saying

4649
02:58:47,120 --> 02:58:48,880
you're going to do harm to somebody, or

4650
02:58:48,880 --> 02:58:52,160
harm should be done to a person who acts

4651
02:58:52,160 --> 02:58:54,800
in a certain way within their rights

4652
02:58:54,800 --> 02:58:56,960
that's where i say - you don't have the

4653
02:58:56,960 --> 02:58:59,359
right to do that

4654
02:58:59,359 --> 02:59:01,279
so, we'll pick this up on the other side

4655
02:59:01,279 --> 02:59:03,600
i'll come finish with this document next

4656
02:59:03,600 --> 02:59:05,920
week, we'll continue with another

4657
02:59:05,920 --> 02:59:07,279
couple of

4658
02:59:07,279 --> 02:59:11,040
recommendations for thelemic readings

4659
02:59:11,040 --> 02:59:12,720
and then we'll go to your calls for the

4660
02:59:12,720 --> 02:59:14,160
duration of the time, and that will

4661
02:59:14,160 --> 02:59:17,040
conclude our mini series here on the

4662
02:59:17,040 --> 02:59:18,880
thelemic philosophy

4663
02:59:18,880 --> 02:59:20,640
thank you all for watching this week

4664
02:59:20,640 --> 02:59:22,560
that's all the time we have - remember

4665
02:59:22,560 --> 02:59:26,000
ladies and gentlemen, government is

4666
02:59:26,000 --> 02:59:27,439
slavery

4667
02:59:27,439 --> 02:59:28,960
and we'll see you right here on what on

4668
02:59:28,960 --> 02:59:32,350
